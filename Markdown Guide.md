	2. Numbered
	3. list
- Task list: hyphen follow by `[ ]` 
```

# Blockquotes
- Simply type > before each line of the quote
>Everyone should strive to maximise their potential
>- Connor Langan

# Code Blocks
- Use backticks to insert code (top left keyboard)
- one backtick for a line of code
	`System.out.println("Obsidian is amazing");`
- three backticks for a block of code
- put coding language after first three backticks for colouring
```java
if(!isDone)
	System.out.println("Hello World!");
	//print "hell0"
else
	//terminate
```
- **Note:** Use SHIFT+ENTER to enter blank lines that are tabbed in already

# Images
- Simply copy an image from online and paste it in a note, or drag it in
- To change the size, add a bar | followed by a number after the file named

![](Images/1617670247obsidian-244838788.jpg)

- Or, if downloaded, drag it in from files
- Or, screenshot, image will be in clipboard, then paste
- To get picture from iPhone, send through LocalSend, will be in downloads
- Same for PDF's

# Tables
- Use `|` to separate columns, and `-|-` after headings
```
First Name|Last Name
-|-
Connor|Langan
Jenna|Mutch
```

First Name|Last Name
-|-
Connor|Langan
Jenna|Mutch

# Math
- Uses MathJax
	- Inline: encase in `$...$`
	- Display Mode: encase in `$$...$$`
- Super and Sub Scripts
	- Superscript: `^`
	- Subscript: `_`
- Groups
	- Use curly braces to group items
	- `10^10` yields $10^10$ , while `10^{10}` yields $10^{10}$ 
	- Other braces act normal
- Operators
	- `\frac{}{}`   first set is numerator, second is denominator
	- `\sqrt[]{}`   square brackets optional(for 3rd root, etc.)
	- `\sum`,  $\sum$  ,   add sub and super scripts 
	- `\log`            add subscript
	- `\sin`, `\lim`, `\max`, `\int` $\sin, \lim, \max, \int$
- Symbols
	- `\lt \gt \le \ge \neq \cdot \in \pm` $\lt, \gt, \le, \ge, \neq, \cdot, \in, \pm$
- Example
	- `$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$`     yields:
$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$
