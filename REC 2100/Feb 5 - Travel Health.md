# Stages of Travel

## Anticipation
- Involves imagination and develops enthusiasm awaiting a trip
- The trip may not actually occur
- Maps, brochures, articles, movies and the internet are studied to research opportunities
## Planning
- An actual trip is going to happen
- Includes gathering supplies, making transport and accommodation arrangements / reservations, passport acquisition, packing, and perhaps physical training
## Travel to Site(s)
- Initial trip to the site or destination
- If you are flying it can be quick
- If you are driving or taking the train etc., the travel might be part of the experience
## Participation
- The core of the trip
- Actually doing the planned activities at your destination
## Returning
- The "gearing down" phase when we start to get ready to return home. 
- Include return travel which can be separate from travel to phase
## Recollection
- After you return home, your participation on a trip is relived through pictures, stories, mementos, memories, keeping the trip alive
