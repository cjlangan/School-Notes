https://www.responsibletravel.com/copy/what-is-overtourism

# What is Overtourism?
- Tourism generally showcased as positive
- Occurs when there are too many visitors in a particular destination
- Each destination may define this differently
	- Rent prices push out locals
	- Traffic jams
	- Wildlife is scarce
	- Tourists can't view landmarks
	- Environments become degraded

# Why Does Overtourism Happen?
- Travel industry focused on growth
- Visitor numbers have been increasing for years
- Not a new problem
- Gained headlines in summer 2017
- Backlash from local residents across Europe

# Key Causes
- Airbnb often targeted - increased availability, not subject to permit/plan
- Government focus on numbers and growth - numbers seen as good, not quality
	- Cheap flights
	- Massive cruise ships - pollution

# Reflection 4 - Overtourism
*Watch the short film and consider the position of the residents and those of the tourists*
- Think back to your last reflection on Human Rights. Do the tourists have the right to travel to these places?
	- Of course
- How can this be balances with residents' rights?
	- 
- Can you think of some ways to mitigate the impacts?
- Does this film change the way you think about your own travel?
