# Air Travel in Canada
Three organisation work together to regulate and standardize air services in Canada
- **Transport Canada** - responsible for transportation policies and programs that promote safe, secure, efficient and environmentally responsible transportation
- **NAV CANADA** - provide air traffic services, critical information, design and build technology and maintain the essential systems that help ensure the safe movement of aircraft
- **International Air Transport Association** – trade association for the world’s airlines, supporting many areas of aviation activity and help formulate industry policy on critical aviation issues

# History of Regulation to Deregulation
- **1937** – Canadian government allowed the Canadian National Railway to operate subsidiary call Trans Canada Airlines
- **1970** – Air travel moved to “regulated competition” where regulations were loosened which allowed charter airlines to emerge
- **1980** – Deregulation of the airline industry began for two main reasons:
	- Recession had weakened existing carriers
	- Dominant airline (Air Canada) was government-owned
- **1987** – National Transportation Act was developed through deregulation
- **1990** – Strategic alliances between global airlines

# Results of Deregulation
- Mergers with larger airlines or bankrupted others.
- Some unprofitable routes were eliminated.
- The hub and spoke system was created.
- No-frill or discount airlines have emerged.
- Feeder airlines serving smaller communities with little competition from major airlines.
