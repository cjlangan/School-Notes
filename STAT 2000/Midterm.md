# Know how to:
- Interpret a p-value
- a confidence interval
- write a properly worded hypothesis test conclusion


# Review
- z-tables, assume we know variance
- know how to find critical value, be aware of percent's in tails
- Remember interpretation of confidence interval
	- repeated sampling of the same size and constructed intervals, then % of them will contain the true mean
- increase confidence level --> interval widens --> MOE increases
- increase sample size by $k$ --> decrease MOE by $\sqrt{k}$
- Z Test Assumptions
	- UM Learn study guide --> assumptions of tests
- Know steps for tests (hypothesis, conclusions...)
- Know how to interpret a p-value
	- under the null hypothesis, the probability of attaining a value at least as extreme as...
- Know how two-tailed test changes things
