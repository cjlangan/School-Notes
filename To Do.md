## Test Section
- Markdown is dope as fuck holy shit
- Here is an image of a ducky wucky so darn cute.

[<img src="Images/duck.png" width="400">](Images/duck.png)

### A Sub-Section
- We can also insert code blocks:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    char message[] = "Hello World!";

    printf("%s", message);

    return 0;
}
```

*Likely by default I shouuld use the `##` headers in the "natural" Markdown*

## Another Section
- Today We will learn about linux terminal commands

### Navigation
- cd [option] -> Change Directory
- ls -> lists all files and folders in current directory
- pwd -> print the current working directory
- touch [filename] -> creates a file
- mkdir [name] -> makes a directory
- rm [file] -> removes a file
    - add -rf to remove folders/directories

### Tools
- htop -> shows processes and their hardware consumption
- neofetch -> shows system information

# Section To test myself 
- Here I will be looking at the live-preview side
- To see if it is feasible, but there is no cursor
- so honestly I'll stick to Neovim
