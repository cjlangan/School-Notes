## Question 4

### (a)

Let $P = \{ (s_1, f_1), (s_2, f_2), ..., (s_n, f_n) \}$. Let $d = (s_d, f_d) \in P$ such that $f_d$ is minimal. Then, there exists a set $S \subset P$ where $d \in S$ and for each $(s_i, f_i) \in S$, $f_i < s_{i+1}$, where $|S|$ is maximal.

### (b)

If $d \in S$ then we are done, so suppose it is not. We want to construct a set $S \prime \subset P$ so that each $(s_i \prime, f_i \prime) \in S \prime$, $f_i \prime < s_{i+1} \prime$ and $d \in S \prime$, where $|S \prime |$ is maximal. Suppose we order the pairs in $S$ by their end time, ie, each $f_i < f_{i+1}$, then the first element, say $v = (s_v, f_v) \in S$ has the lowest $f$, so for each $(s_i, f_i) \in S$, $f_v < f_i$ and $f_v < s_i$. But, we know that $f_d < f_v$, since $f_d$ must be the lowest $f$ in $P$. So, if we let $S \prime = \{ S \backslash v \} \cup d$, then for each $(s_i \prime, f_i \prime) \in S \prime$, we have $f_d < f_i \prime$ and $f_d < s_i \prime$. So, then reordering $S \prime$ to be sorted by $s$, we get that for each $(s_i \prime, f_i \prime) \in S \prime$, $f_i \prime < s_{i+1} \prime$. Next, we can see that $|S \prime| = |S| - 1 + 1 = |S|$, so $|S \prime|$ is maximal.
