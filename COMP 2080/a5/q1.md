## Question 1

Assume that the concerts in $P$ are sorted by start time.

### (a)

The items in a solution $S$ are concerts/pairs $(s_i, f_i)$ from $P$ to attend, where $s$ represents the concerts' start time, and $f$ represent the concerts' end time. Note that $s_i < f_i$ must be true.

A feasible solution $S$ is a set of concerts/pairs, where $S \subset P = \{ (s_1, f_1)(s_2, f_2),..., (s_n, f_n) \}$. Where for any $(s_i, f_i) \in S$, $f_i < s_{i+1}$. That is, the previous concert must end before the next concert starts, ie, no concerts overlaps.

An optimal solution is a feasible solution $S$, where $|S|$ is maximal. That is, $S$ is the set of concerts to attend to ensure the most concerts are attended.

### (b)

Given a solution $S \subset P = \{ (s_1, f_1)(s_2, f_2),..., (s_n, f_n) \}$, let's remove an arbitrary concert $C = (s_c, f_c) \in S$ and the concerts that overlap with it from the problem. So let $S \prime = S \backslash C$ and we are done since no concerts in $S$ overlap with $C$. Then, let $O$ be the set of concerts from $P$ that overlap with $C$. Specifically, for all concerts say $J = (s_j, f_j) \in P$, if $s_j < s_c$ and $f_j > s_c$, OR, if $s_j > s_c$ and $s_j < f_c$, then add concert $J$ to $O$. Then, let $P \prime = P \backslash \{ C \cup O \}$. The resulting subproblem is to find a set $S \prime \subset P \prime$ so that for all $(s_i \prime, f_i \prime) \in S \prime$, $f_i \prime < s_{i+1} \prime$, ie, no overlaps, where $|S \prime|$ is maximal.
