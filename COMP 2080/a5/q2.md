## Question 2

Assume that the concerts in $P$ are sorted by start time.

### (a)

Let $S \subset P = \{ (s_1, f_1)(s_2, f_2),..., (s_n, f_n) \}$. Choose an arbitrary concert $C = (s_c, f_c) \in S$ and the concerts that overlap with it. Let $O$ be the set of concerts from $P$ that overlap with $C$. Specifically, for all concerts say $J = (s_j, f_j) \in P$, if $s_j < s_c$ and $f_j > s_c$, OR, if $s_j > s_c$ and $s_j < f_c$, then add concert $J$ to $O$. Then, let $P \prime = P \backslash \{ C \cup O \}$. Let $S \prime = S \backslash C$ and we are done since no concerts in $S$ overlap with $C$, ie, $O \not \in S \prime$ already. Then $S \prime$ is the set of concerts from $P \prime$ so that for all $(s_i \prime, f_i \prime) \in S \prime$, $f_i \prime < s_{i+1} \prime$, ie, no overlaps, where $|S \prime|$ is maximal.

### (b)

We will show that $|S \prime |$ is maximal. Assume, in hopes of contradiction, that $|S \prime|$ is not maximal, that is, there exists a set of pairs $T \prime \subset P \prime$, so that for every $(s_i \prime, f_i \prime) \in T \prime$, $f_i \prime < s_{i+1} \prime$, where $|T \prime| > |S \prime|$. Let $T = T \prime \cup C$, so $|T| = |T \prime| + 1$. 

First, we will show that $T$ is feasible for $P$. Since $P \prime = P \backslash \{ C \cup O \}$, $P \prime$ contains no pairs that overlap with $C$, so since $T \prime \subset P \prime$, it follows that $T \prime$ contains no pairs that overlap with $C$ either. Therfore, when unionizing $C$ with $T \prime$ to form $T$, there will be no overlapping, ie, for every $(s_i, f_i) \in T$, $f_i < s_{i+1}$. Thus, $T$ is feasible for $P$.

Now, $|T| = |T \prime| + 1 > |S \prime| + 1 = |S|$, contradicting the fact that $|S|$ is maximal. Thus, $|S \prime|$ must be maximal.
