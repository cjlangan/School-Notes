## Question 7

### (a)

Let $T(n)$ be the cost of the algorithm. Then, since we recursively operate on the left and right halves of the input array, and we iterate through all $n$ elements per recursive call, we derive the following recurrence relation:

$$
 T(n) =
\begin{cases}
1,  & \text{$n = 1$} \\
T(n/2) + n, & \text{$n > 1$}
\end{cases}
$$

The cost of the base case is $1$, since we simply return the single element.

### (b)

Let $a = 2, b = 2, c = 1, d = 1$, and $f(n) = n$. Then, $a, c \geq 1, b > 1$, and $d \geq 0$. So we may proceed to use the Master Theorem to derive the cost of the algorithm.

We see that $\log_b(a) = \log_2(2) = 1$, so $n^{\log_2(2)} = n^1$. Then $f(n) \in \Theta (n)$, so case 2 gives us:

$$T(n) \in \Theta (n \log(n))$$
