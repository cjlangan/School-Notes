## Question 3

### (a) 

```
maxSumTabulate(A):
    n = A.length
    T is a table/array of length n
    max = T[0]
    for(k = 1; k < n; k++):
        T[k] = max(T[k - 1] + A[k], A[k])
        if(T[k] > max):
            max = T[k]
    return max
```

### (b)

There is one loop that iterates over all n entries, and the cost within the loop is fixed. So, the cost is $\Theta (n)$.
