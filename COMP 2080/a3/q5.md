#### Proof:

(1) Let $f$ and $g$ be arbitrary functions from $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ to $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. Suppose that $g \in \omega (f)$. That is, 

$$\forall M > 0 \quad \exists n_0 > 0 \quad \forall n > n_0 \quad (g(n) \geq Mf(n))$$

We wish to show that $g + f \in \omega (f)$, that is, 

$$\forall M \prime > 0 \quad \exists n_0 \prime > 0 \quad \forall n > n_0 \prime \quad (g(n) + f(n) \geq M \prime f(n)).$$

(2) Let $M \prime > 0$ be arbitrary and let $M = M \prime - 1$.

(3) Let $n_0 > 0$ be so that $\forall n > n_0$, $g(n) \geq Mf(n)$. By (1), such an $n_0$ exists. 

(4) Let $n_0 \prime = n_0$. Let $n > n_0 \prime$ be arbitrary. Then $n > n_0$, so

$$g(n) + f(n) \geq Mf(n) + f(n) \text{,  by (3)}$$

$$= (M \prime - 1)f(n) + f(n) \text{,  by (2)}$$

$$= M \prime f(n) - f(n) + f(n)$$

$$= M \prime f(n)$$

as needed.

(5) Thus, $g \in \omega (f) \implies g + f \in \omega (f)$.
