## Question 5

### Find a function $f(n)$ that counts the number of times that $fnc()$ is called as a function with the input $n$.

(1) Assume $n \geq 3$ and $\exists a \in \mathbb{N}, n =3^a$. 

(2) From the loop invariant, we know that $x = 3^r$.

(3) The outer loop starts at $x=3$ and is then multiplied by $3$ each iteration until it is executed for the last time when $x = n$, since $\exists a \in \mathbb{N}, n =3^a$ from (1). So, $x=3, 9, 27, 81, ..., 3^a$. Similarly, $r$ starts at $r=1$ and increases by one each iteration, and by (2), $x = 3^r \implies r = \log_3x$, so we get $x=3^1, 3^2, 3^3, ..., 3^a$, and thus $r=1, 2, 3, ..., a$. But, from (1), $n = 3^a \implies a= \log_3(n)$. So the number of iterations from the outer loop is

$$\sum_{r=1}^{log_3n}(1)$$

(4) Now, from (2), since $x=3^r$, clearly $x$ must be odd.

(5) Next, the inner loop starts at $j=0$ and increases by $2$ until it executes for the last time when $j = x - 1$, since, from (4), $x$ is odd. So, $j=0, 2, 4, .., x-1$. But, from (2), we get $j=0, 2, 4, ..., 3^r-1$. Now, let $k = j/2$, then $k=0, 1, 2, 3, ..., (3^r-1)/2$. Thus, the number of iterations of the inner loop is

$$\sum_{k=0}^{\frac{3^r-1}{2}}(1) = \frac{3^r-1}{2}-0+1 = \frac{3^r+1}{2}$$

(6) Finally, since the loops are nested, and $fnc()$ is called once every inner loop iteration, the number of times $fnc()$ is called is

$$\sum_{r=1}^{log_3n}(\frac{3^r+1}{2})$$
$$= \frac{1}{2}[\sum_{r=1}^{log_3n}(3^r) + \sum_{r=1}^{log_3n}(1)]$$
$$= \frac{1}{2}[\frac{3^{\log_3(n)+1}-1}{2}-3^0+ \log_3(n)]$$
$$= \frac{1}{2}[\frac{(3^{\log_3(n)})(3^1)-1}{2}-1+ \log_3(n)]$$
$$= \frac{1}{2}[\frac{3n-1}{2}-1+ \log_3(n)]$$
$$= \frac{1}{2}[\frac{3n-3}{2}+ \log_3(n)]$$

(7) Thus, a fucntion $f(n)$ that counts the number of times that $fnc()$ is called as a funciton with the input $n$ is

$$f(n) = \frac{1}{2}[\frac{3n-3}{2}+ \log_3(n)]$$
