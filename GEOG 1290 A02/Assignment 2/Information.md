## Goals
- Relate to the world around you with a geographic lens
- Academic tone, credible sources, figures, tables, diagrams (with captions)

## Theme: Meteorological Hazard
Use a personal or a credible online image of a specific meteorological hazard classed as one of the following:
1. Hurricane
2. Tornado
3. Blizzard
4. Heat Wave
5. Polar Vortex

For background information, consult the course lectures (Section I), the course textbook, Arbogast et al. (2018, chapter 8) and  find a credible source that defines a natural hazard and disaster such as the World Meteorological Association (WMO) (2022, para. 1). The glossary of the Arbogast et al. (2018) textbook and Keller and DeVecchio (2019) textbook may also provide useful definitions.000

# Rules
1. include three sections using proper paragraph structure (some sections might have more than one paragraph), each with the following headings: 
	- What's Where?
	- Why There?
	- Why Care?

2. Include relevant background information that defines what's there/explains why there/illustrates why care using at least four (4) different credible academic sources overall AND at least two (2) different credible sources per paragraph (see information below about source requirements);

3. Include a word count at the end of the "Why Care?" section (word count includes all three sections but NOT the references in the "References" section)

4. Maximum of ***one*** direct quote (one sentence long)

5. At least ***one*** relevant, properly labelled and referenced figure that has a descriptive caption and corresponding in-text citation, reference. (At least 1-2 sentences explaining the most important parts of the figure)

6. At least ***one*** map that shows the relevant location of the feature being discussed. Properly labelled, descriptive caption, in-text citation, reference

## Paragraphs
- Start with topic sentence, finish with summary and transition to next paragraph.

## What's Where?
- Descriptive spatial section, define theme
- Include call-out to image and map.

	**Extra**
	- Define significant terms
	- All features of the Earth's surface have a spatial distribution
	- Describe the:
		- absolute and/or relative location
		- site and situation (specific details and relationship to other features)
		- accessibility
		- connectivity
		- distribution and/or pattern
	- Identify the scale of the feature (cm, m, km ; local, regional, global)

## Why There?
- Analysis of process and/or interrelationships acting on the concept. 
- Why is it located where it is? How did it get there? What processes are acting on it? How does it relate to other concepts?

## Why Care?
- Importance and relevance of concept.
- Why does it matter to you/society/the world/anyone? What actions have occurred and what reactions have resulted? Environmental implications?
- Put in geographic context, may relate physical and human geography
