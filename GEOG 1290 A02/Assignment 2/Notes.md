- **Disaster:** One possible effect of a hazard on society. Usually a sudden event that causes great damage or loss of life during a limited time and in a limited geographic area. - Glossary, p. 618
- Hurricane Harvey in 2017 produced peak accumulations of rainfall of more than 1.5 m (~60 in.) over a three-day period causing catastrophic flooding in the Houston metropolitan area - Preface, para 2
-  producing the largest and most serious urban flood in U.S. history. Total dam- ages will probably approach $200 billion - Flooding, Houston Flood of 2017, para 1

- The result of the unprecedented amount of rain was catastrophic flooding which inundated much of the city and surrounding areas with several feet of water. Freeways and streets became rivers (Figure 6.1). The floodwaters displaced about 1 million people and damaged about 200,000 homes and several hundred thousand automobiles. Many thousands of people were rescued by boat and helicopter (Figure 6.2) and spent time in emergency shelters. - Flooding, Houston Flood of 2017, para 1
- The 2017 hurricane season was catastrophic and the costliest U.S. hurricane season in history, both financially (~$300 Billion) and in loss of life (~3,000 killed). Estimates from Hurricane Harvey alone are between $180 and $200 billion (USD) - Hurricanes and Extratropical cyclones, 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season: Record Breaking, para 1
- Hurricane Harvey was the first Atlantic storm with hurricane strength to make landfall in the United States. Crossing the Texas shoreline 217 km (135 mi.) south- west of Houston as a Category 4 Hurricane. Persisting for almost five days after making landfall, doubling the longevity of any prior recorded hurricane on land, which consequently led to record-breaking rainfall and flooding in Texas (see Chapter 6 Applying the Fundamental Concepts). High winds and a 2–3 m (7–12 ft.) storm surge also resulted in extensive damage along the Gulf coast. By September 1 Hurricane Harvey had moved inland and was dissipating over Tennessee, and has ultimately been credited with 90 deaths in the United States—most of which were from drowning. - Same, but para 2

- Harvey began off the western coast of Africa as a convective thunderstorm, characterised by rising air which coalesced to create a low pressure centre. drawing in air from the surrounding area, producing strong surface winds and forming a tropical depression. The conditions required to generate such proto-hurricanes are relatively well understood:
	- sea temperature needs to be at least 26.5˚C
	- the vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere needs to cool enough with height to enable convective thunderstorms to form
	- there needs to be humid air in the troposphere
	- there needs to be low wind shear (both horizontal and vertical) with height
	- the storm needs to be at least 550 km from the Equator so that the Coriolis force can establish cyclonic rotation (which is why you don’t find cyclonic weather systems within 5 degrees of the Equator).

	- Harvey made landfall near Rockport in Texas late morning on 25 August as a category 4 hurricane with sustained wind speeds of at least 210 kph. Normally a hurricane would dissipate and lose energy as it progresses inland but Harvey remained virtually stationary above Houston because its path was blocked by two high-pressure systems sitting in the south-eastern and south- western USA. In this position, it was able to draw water vapour from a particularly warm patch of ocean surface in the Gulf of Mexico, sustaining its energy and producing exceptional amounts of precipitation due to positive feedback by pulling warm moisture back up into itself and dumping it again as rainfall, producing exceptional amounts of precipitation, particularly in the north-east quadrant. Up to 131.8cm (52 inches) of rain fell on Houston over a period of 5 days, in addition to significant coastal flooding caused by storm surge (Figure 3). - Page 2, Harvey and Irma, Hurricane Harvey, para 1
	- After three days Harvey moved back out onto the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall again just before dawn on 30 August in Louisiana, then proceeding inland and dissipating - same but para 2

- Natural hazards—Hazards occur when extreme events result in danger to humans. Examples of natural hazards include hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, earthquakes, and volcanoes. Natural hazards are a particularly important area of geographical study because as the global population grows, increasing numbers of people are moving into areas that are susceptible to extreme natural events. For example, as you may be aware, there is potential for the West Coast of Canada to experience a major earthquake in the future. There have been many earthquakes in British Columbia in the past few decades, though an extremely large and devastating earthquake has not occurred in hundreds of years. Physical geographers have been conducting research on the tectonic plates off the coast of British Columbia, as well as analysing historical earthquakes through research on tsunami and tree-ring studies, among other things, and trying to learn as much as possible about the best ways to mitigate the impacts of a major earthquake. Each time an earthquake occurs somewhere in the world, studies are made of the engineered structures to see how they can be improved for future buildings. In addition, a large part of earthquake readiness is making sure the population is aware of the risk and as prepared for an earthquake as they can be. Geographers work with many other types of professionals to make the at- risk areas of British Columbia as ready as possible for a future large earthquake. - glossary
- tropical cyclone: A tropical circulatory system with maximum sustained winds greater than 119 km/h (64 knots). - glossary
- About 80 tropical cyclones develop around the world every year, with the strongest becoming extremely powerful storms that, depending on the part of the world, are called hurricanes, typhoons, or cyclones. - Air masses and cyclonic weather systems, tropical cyclones, para 1
- The source of energy for a tropical cyclone is water vapour that is evaporated from the ocean’s surface. A tropical cyclone needs the warm, moist air to “fuel” the storm. The source of fuel that powers a tropical cyclone is the latent heat of condensation, created when water vapour condenses to form clouds and rain, warming the surrounding air. Usually, the latent heat that is released during condensation is carried away by wind shear, but when there is minimal wind shear, the heat builds up, causing low pressure to form. The latent heat is released as it rises near the centre of the cyclone, causing low pressure near the surface and higher pressure aloft, which generates the circulation. The air spirals inward toward the centre of the low and the Coriolis effect causes the airflow to be deflected, creating a rotating spiral structure. The air is moving so quickly toward the low that huge waves are generated, which causes increased evaporation and increases the moisture in the air. The rotating airflow continues to pull in more moisture, which releases more latent heat and adds power to the storm (a positive feedback loop). - same but para 7

- Tropical cyclones are also called hurricanes or typhoons, depending on the region. A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm that begins over tropical oceans, and they can vary in speed, size, and intensity. Tropical cyclones are the second-most dangerous natural hazards, after earthquakes. - Natural Hazards, para 1
- Tropical cyclones can often include multiple hazards, such as extreme winds, heavy rainfall, storm surge and flooding, lightning and tornadoes. When these hazards interact, they can significantly increase the danger and threat that a tropical cyclone can pose. - Overview, para 2
- Tropical cyclones are one of the biggest threats to life and property - Overview, para 1
- Each year, tropical cyclones cause multiple casualties, deaths, and significant damage to property and infrastructure in the immediate term. - Impact, para 1
- Over the past 50 years, 1,945 disasters have been attributed to tropical cyclones, which killed 779,324 people and caused US$ 1.4 trillion in economic losses – an average of 43 deaths and US$ 78 million in damages daily. - para 2
- Tropical cyclones represented 17% of weather-, climate- and water related disasters and were responsible for one third of both deaths (38%) and economic losses (38%) over the 50-year period. - para 3
- Climate change is linked not only to an increased likelihood of major hurricanes, but also to direct increases in their destructive power. - para 5

- Hurricane Harvey made landfall as a Category 4 storm on August 26, 2017 near Rockport, Texas. The wettest tropical cyclone to affect the United States, Harvey’s effects were widespread and resulted in flooding that the National Weather Service called “catastrophic, devastating, and deadly.” - Page 1, Place and Time, para 1

- Although the colossal volume of rainfall drenched every part of Houston, the most impacted people were the most marginalized. Harvey may not have specifically targeted the poor, but the poor have struggled the most to recover from it. Because of racially and economically discriminatory policies by the City of Houston, low-income communities of colour were the least prepared for and most impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Even as the clean-up effort continues, poor minorities face more hurdles than their wealthy, White counterparts. The local, state, and federal governments should ensure that their aid distribution policies are fair and non-discriminatory to ensure that all communities can effectively recover. - para 6

- On August 17, 2017, Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine formed about 300 km (482 miles) east of Barbados in the Lesser Antilles. Harvey moved westward over the Windward Islands on Friday, August 18, bringing tropical storm force winds to Barbados, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The following day, Harvey degenerated into a tropical wave as wind shear and dry air weakened the system. The remnants of Harvey tracked west-northwest across the Caribbean over the next several days.- page 4, para 1
- About 12 hours later, Harvey reached Category 2 strength with winds of 44.7 m/s (87 kts) by early afternoon on the 25th. Harvey became a major hurricane with winds of 53.6 m/s (104 kts) while situated about 120 km (75 miles) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas. Harvey continued to intensify and made landfall as a Category 4 storm with winds of 58.1 m/s (133 kts) between Port Aransas and Port O’Connor, Texas at 03:00 GMT on August 26 - para 3
- Following landfall, Harvey moved inland and weakened to a tropical storm by midday August 26. The storm drastically slowed down and remained almost stationary through August 27 before drifting slowly to the east-southeast and re-emerging over the Gulf of Mexico early on the 28th. Tropical Storm Harvey continued a slow south-easterly movement reaching about 160 km (100 miles) offshore before the track shifted once again. The storm then moved north-eastward parallel to the Texas coast beginning early NOAA NOS Hurricane Harvey Water Level & Meteorological Data Report 6 on August 29 before curving north and making a second landfall near Cameron, Louisiana at 09:00 GMT on August 30 with winds of 20 m/s (39 kts). Harvey continued to track northward and became post- tropical on August 31. Harvey’s slow meandering movement resulted in historic rainfall across eastern Texas and western Louisiana, including the Houston metropolitan area, causing catastrophic flooding. - para 4
