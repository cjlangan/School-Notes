- Normal room
- Sections G, H, I, J
- 60 MC in 50 minutes
- Up to 10% from assigned readings
- Up to 10% from Sections A-F

- Orographic lifting: mountain lift winds, causes rain
- Chinook develop in leeward side/rain shadow side
- During el nino, trade winds weaken and may reverse direction
- An upper air divergence in polar jet stream makes a high pressure
- Sufficient water vapour for cumulonimbus cloud, also wind shear and unstable atmosphere
- Collision coalescence process is for rain droplet growth in lower latitudes
- Ice crystal process for higher latitude, sometimes can get both
- advection - horizontal movement, so horizontal moving fog is advection fog
- occluded front is triangle and circle on top

- cold front is quickest, catches up to warm one
- Mature thunderstorm is well established updraft and downdraft
![[Pasted image 20240318105656.png]]
- cumulonimbus clouds likely develop on converging side of wave
![[Pasted image 20240318105904.png]]
- Clear skies on diverging side
- This is an easterly/tropical wave
- negative step leader is first step in lightning
- Open wave cyclone stage is when clear separated cold and warm front

- Nor' easters are mid latitude cyclones that are similar to hurricanes
- polar jet stream causes midlatitude cyclones
- eye of hurricane - warm air descends...
- in hurricane, strongest winds in eye wall
- Tropical cyclones only form over  warm ocean water
- North Atlantic hurricane seas is late summer to early autumn
- death of midlatitude cyclone is occlusion (cold from catches warm front)
- lowest atmospheric pressure is in a tornado
- Widespread stratus cloud development associated with warm front
- cumulonimbus with cold front
- occluded front, warm air mass off ground
- Anti-cyclone = clear skies
- outer core is liquid
- inner core is solid
- metamorphic counterpart to limestone is marble
- sedimentary is weather rocks made from other rocks
- felsic and sialic on earths crust
- foliations in gneiss
- most common sedimentary rock is shale
