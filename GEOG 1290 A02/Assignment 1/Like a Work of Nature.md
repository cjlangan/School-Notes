## Abstract
- Panama's transit zone, a region with long human history, appeared more natural to visitors
- The landscape was transformed between 1911 and 1914 through the flooding of the massive Gatun lake
## Introduction
- June 1906, US Congress approved construction of a lock canal across the isthmus of Panama. para 1
- Connects the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean and pass through three lock chambers on either side. para 1
- the canal shaped the geography of US imperialism on the isthmus, with profound implications for Panama's environmental history. para 1
- It is a flawed assumption that large technological projects are complete when construction ends. para 2
- Canal requires constant maintenance and management. para 2
- Gatun Lake is twenty miles of the 48 mile long shipping channel. para 4
- Gatun Lake was designed to store water from drainage from the rainy season for use throughout the dry season. para 4
- As work on the Gatun Dam advanced in 1911, the flow of the Chagres River to the Caribbean was interrupted and the lake began to rise. para 5
- The landscapes surrounding were depopulated and began growing many trees. para 6
- Natural scientists who travelled to document environmental changes mistook an engineered waterscape for timeless tropical nature. para 6

## "Like a Work of Nature"
- The man-made lake covered what used to be forests, farms, work camps, and villages. para 2
- The lake rose so far above the water that it formed lagoons, ponds, turning rapid, unnavigable streams into deep, sluggish rivers, and hilltops were now islands. para 3

## Paisajes Perdidos (Lost Landscapes)
- The lake is 85 feet above sea level. para 3
- In 1912 US president William Howard Taft decreed that "all land and land under water within the limits of the Canal Zone is necessary for the construction, maintenance, operation, sanitisation or protection of the Panama Canal". para 4
- So, residents could not use this land, (hence why it became so tropical)
