## Abstract
- The Panama Canal requires an enormous amount of freshwater to function. A staggering 52 million gallons are released into the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans with each of the 35-45 ships that transit the canal daily.
- The water that facilitates these travels (global connection) falls as rain across the watershed surrounding the canal

## 540
- Five percent of global commerce moves through the canal's lock and dam system. para 3

- Ships are raised and lowered in the locks using water and gravity technology. para 1
- First, a ship slides into the lock chamber and massive steel gates slowly close, then a lockmaster opens valves in a water storage reservoir located above the locks. Water surges through culverts the size of subway tunnels in the concrete chamber walls, enters cross-culverts beneath its floor, and then erupts upward, lifting a ship and its cargo. para 1
- On small farms as far as 25 miles upstream from the shipping lane, forest guards inspect secondary growth of grass, bushes and trees to determine when the land can be classified as a forest and thereby protected by the state to 'produce' water for the Canal. para 2 (so, environment does well because they *need* water produced)

## 546
- Two proposals were made: a sea-level canal and the lock system canal, the projected cost and time of the lock system were lower than the sea-level option, so that is ultimately why this design was chosen. para 3
- Additionally, it would reduce landslides. para 3

## 547
- the Chagres river consistently supplied an enormous volume of freshwater to the canal. para 1
