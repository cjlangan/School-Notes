peak solar radiation is visible light


# Test Review
- solar wind for auroras
- lowest albedo is tropical rainforest 
- equatorial diameter is slightly larger by less than 1% than polar diameter
- graphic map scale
- tropospheric temperature inversion: temperature increases
- Coriolis effect is 3, friction is 4
- 37 degrees = net radiation of 0
- dynamic pressure creates subtropical highs and subpolar lows
- thermal pressures at ITCZ and polar highs
- earth is 3.3% closer to the sun during northern hemisphere winter
- earth tilt means poles are warmer
- stratospheric ozone concentrations lowest over south pole
- biggest factor controlling distribution of temp is the latitude
- troposphere thicker in tropics due to Earth's rotation
- source of warming in middle to upper stratosphere in mid to upper is ___
- higher temp objects emit radiation at higher rates is ____

# Review after:
- Moho is boundary between crust and upper mantle
- Radiogenic heat drives surface processes
