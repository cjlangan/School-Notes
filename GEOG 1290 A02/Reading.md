**Acid Rain Definition:**
- Acid rain is the broad term applied to the way in which industrial acids fall out of the atmosphere in association with precipitation. It is caused by the deposition of acidic substances resulting from human industrial activity.

**North America Acid Rain Pollutants:**
- The main pollutants contributing to acid rain in North America are sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).

**Sulphur Dioxide Sources:**
- The majority of sulphur dioxide emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels for electricity and heating. Other significant sources include non-ferrous smelters (producing metals like nickel and copper) and emissions from the oil and gas sector.

**Nitrogen Oxide Sources:**
- Nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere come from the burning of fossil fuels, including coal, in transportation vehicles (such as cars, trains, planes, and boats), the oil and gas industry, and electric power generation.

**Deposition Process & Acid pH:**
- Acid rain is deposited on the Earth's surface through dry deposition of larger particles or through wet deposition via precipitation or within fog. In North America, particularly in the eastern regions downwind of industrial cities, the pH of rainfall is around 4, indicating acidic conditions.

**Impact of Acid Rain on the Landscape:**
- Acid rain has significant impacts on landscapes, accelerating chemical weathering and stressing forests and lakes. Forests in affected areas experience soil acidification, which accelerates nutrient leaching and reduces tree tolerance to cold weather. Lakes and ponds can also experience lowered pH levels, affecting aquatic life.

**US & Canada Trends for Acid Rain:**
- Environmental regulations imposed in association with the Clean Air Act and the Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement have had a positive effect on reducing acid rain emissions in both the United States and Canada. Emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides have significantly decreased since the 1990s, indicating progress in addressing the issue of acid rain in North America.
