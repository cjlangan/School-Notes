- The Matterhorn is prominently known due to its archetypi-
cal form, the famous climbing route up the Hörnligrat ridge
(northeastern ridge of the Matterhorn) and its dramatic first
ascent on 14 July 1865. This first successful alpine conquests
on the Matterhorn were actually undertaken by researchers:
first ascent led by Edward Whymper, a writer and landscape - p. 1204, Section 2, para 1
- On 15 July 2003 a single rock volume of approximately
1500 m3 released from the Hörnligrat at 3500 ma.s.l. (white
arrow in Fig. 1a, CH1903+ 617950/92168) uncovering bare
ice in the failure plan (see red arrows in Fig. 1b and c) (Hasler
et al., 2012). Although insignificant on the scale of a moun-
tain the age and size of the Matterhorn as a whole, this partic-
ular incident showed significant susceptibility on the human
scale to the processes governing such rockfall: as this rockfall
event occurred in the middle of the summer climbing season
and directly affected the popular climbing route to the sum-
mit, it led to the evacuation of 84 climbers by helicopter, the
temporary closure of the climbing route and other mitigation
measures (Haeberli et al., 2015). - p 1205 para 3

- Abstract
	- The Matterhorn, a famous mountain in the Swiss Alps is a well characterized geomorphosite, presenting both an important scientific interest and aesthetic, cultural and economic values in Switzerland. The main scientific issues concerning the Matterhorn are its place in the [tectonic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tectonics "Learn more about tectonic from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") history of the Alps, the carving of a residual pyramid by [glacial erosion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/glacial-erosion "Learn more about glacial erosion from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and the effects of melting of high mountain [permafrost](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/permafrost "Learn more about permafrost from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") on mountaineering. the Matterhorn can be analyzed through four time scales:(1) the deep time of tectonics during the [Cenozoic era](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/cenozoic-era "Learn more about Cenozoic era from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), which saw the thrusting and piling up of the “Pennine nappes,” due to the collision between African and [European plates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/eurasian-plate "Learn more about European plates from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"); (2) the [Quaternary period](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/quaternary-period "Learn more about Quaternary period from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of glacial erosion, which carved the Matterhorn into its distinctive pyramidal peak shape;(3) the [Anthropocene](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/anthropocene "Learn more about Anthropocene from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") time of the thawing of high mountain permafrost; and (4) the era of humans or mountaineering, which spans over than 150 years, from the first ascent in 1865 to the recent achievements of modern mountaineering.
- Introduction
	- 4,478 meters tall, para 1
	- located in the Pennine Alps of Switzerland, para 1
	- Conspicuous pyramid shape, para 1
	- In 1865, a time when most of the summits of the Alps had been climbed, the Matterhorn remained unconquered despite of many attempts and was regarded as invincible by many - para 1
	- Climbing it is an exceptional alpine achievement, para 1

	- Quoted as the best example of a geomorphosite, para 3
	- The pyramid shape is attributed to glacial erosion, para 4
- 2. Materials and Methods
	- The glacial erosion has been occuring the entire quaternary period (2.588 million years), para 2

- 3. Results
	- Matterhorn is a result of the collision of African and European tectonic plates, 3.1
	- Permafrost: all lithospheric materials that experience long-term temperature below 0 degrees Celcius, 3.3
	- At a base camp on the Matterhorn (Hörnli Hütte), a depth of 100m permafrost is present, with an active layer thickness of 3m, 3.3
	- In switzerland the name and image of the matterhorn are everywhere, such as on chocolate, banks, even lingerie. 3.6
	- for many Years the Matterhorn was on the famous Swiss chocolate Toblerone, 3.6
	- On the Matterhorn, the primary rock climbed is gneiss, found on both faces and the ridges, 4.1
	- 99% of the mountain is sublime heaps of stone, it isn't very stable for climbing despite its sturdy look, 4.1
	- Global warming is responsible for the degredation and thawing of the high mountain permafrost, leading to destabilization and significant collapses. 4.3
	- The new American company owner of Toblerone relocated production to Slovakia, thus losing their right to use the Matterhorn image, showing its strong correlation to Swiss identity, 4.5

- Abstract
	- Increase in rockfall events in Matterhorn Peak area since 2003
- Conclusions
	- The progressive growth in socioeconomic activities in alpine areas (e.g., tourism) has led to an increase in risks related to local natural hazards, such as rockfalls. In recent years, observed incremental increases in the number of seismic instabilities, which could be connected to climatic changes and fluctuations, have contributed to making this situation worse. - para 1
	- Most microseismic events occured when the temperaturce decreases from warm to cold, para 4

- Abstract
	- Rocks of Matterhorn have an African origin
	- the base of Matterhorn has a mesozoic marine origin
	- the pyramid itself is constituted by a gneissic paleozoic complex, less sold than it seems
	- the summit is formed of resistant gneiss
	- Geomorphologically, the Matterhorn is a karling: an angular peak with steep walls and sharp ridges carved away by glacial erosion
	- Most of it is frozen, however, permasfrost melting is very active today, causing rockfalls
- Introduction
	- location: (45°58’21’’ N, 7°39’18’’ E; 4478 m a.s.l.), para 1
	- at the Swiss–Italian border, para 1
	- Not the highest of the Alps, but is the most iconic, para 1

		- Location of the Matterhorn and Zermatt in South-west Switzerland. The Matterhorn (red circle) is situated at the border with Italy (Valtournenche Valley), in the upper part of the _Mattertal_, a valley drained by the Vispa River, a tributary of the Rhone River (swisstopo)
- The rocks of matterhorn date from the paleozoic period. These are gneisses and silicate marbles, 2.1
- freeze-thaw alternation is a daily process, contributing to the erosion, 3.2
- For the Matterhorn, several glacial cirques cause erosion, forming its popular horn, 3.3, para 3
- ### **Discussion—The Matterhorn, an example of fractured bedrock** **permafrost** - By Emmanuel Reynard, University of Lausanne
	- Matterhorn is example of fractured bedrock permafrost, para 1
	- Fractures are filled with with ice. freeze thaw cycles cause rockfalls

		- the moving ice contains particles of sand or rock fragments that are frozen to the bottom of the ice. As the ice moves, these fragments scratch and gouge the underlying bedrock - para 2
