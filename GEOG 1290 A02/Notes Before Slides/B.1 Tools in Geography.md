# Learning Objectives
• Compare & contrast the components of Earth’s geographic grid.
• Discuss the concepts of map projection & scale & why they are important when designing maps.

## Geographers deal with spatial phenomena (location)
Use unique tools to represent:
**Location**
• Determining location: GPS
**Cartography**
• Geographic Grid
• Map Scale
**Imaging Earth**
	Remote sensing
**Geographic information systems (GIS)**
**Models and statistics**


# Location
- **Absolute Location** is a precise system of locating a place in space, usually using latitude and longitude

- **Relative location** is referencing a place in comparison to another place

# Determining Location: Global Positioning Systems (GPS)
- System of satellites and receivers
- Determine location in the geographic grid
	- 24 satellites orbit earth every 12 hours
	- Signals from up to four satellites overlap to pinpoint location (triangulation) (more satellites = more accuracy)
- Pseudorandom Code (PSR) transmits in sequence of pulses

# The Geographic Grid & Georeferencing

**Spatial reference points**
- Equatorial plane (equator)
	- Parallel of 0 degrees latitude(north/south of equator)
	- it is a reference point
- Rotation Axis
- North and South Pols
	- Axis of rotation emerges
	- equatorial plane is halfway between poles and perpendicular to them

## Parallels vs. Meridians
![[Pasted image 20240112110811.png]]

# Latitude
- Angular measurement, expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds
- 360 degrees in circle, 60 minutes in 1 degree, 60 seconds in one minutes
	- +90 is north, -90 is south
- Parallel at zero degrees is equator
- Each degree = 111 kilometres

# Seven Significant Latitudes
![[Pasted image 20240112111200.png]]
- Numbers are important
- 23.5 is tilt of Earth

# World Latitude Zones
![[Pasted image 20240112111257.png]]

# Longitude
- Angle - 180 °E - 0 ° - 180 °W

## Meridians (lines) connect the poles
- Prime Meridian (0° longitude) east or west of Greenwich
• Furthest apart at equator, closest at poles
	• 1° = 111 km at equator
	• 1° = 0 km at poles

# Differences between parallels and meridians

# International Date Line
- Moving west across date line: 
	- advance calendar one day (lose a day)
- Moving east across date line: 
	- set calendar back one day (have the same day twice)
- The line falls on the 180th meridian
     -  Exception: it meanders to ensure two island groupings aren’t split
	     apart in their schedules (e.g. Aleutian or South Pacific Islands)

# Mapping of Earth
Two important characteristics:
- A map is  not the territory it represents
- but, if correct has a similar structure to the territory (represents usefulness)
-Alfred Korzybski
**conveys idea that people often confuse models of reality with reality itself**
- A map provides a picture, but misses many detail ; Similar, not exact replica.
- Model attempts to take complicated reality and simply it so it can be understood
- Example: Systems theory.

# Maps - The Basic Tool of Geographers

**Cartography:** art and science of map making
**Cartographer:** focuses on ways to display spatial information so it can be used and understood efficiently
A **globe** is the most visually complete and accurate way to represent the Earth
- However globes have issues: not portable, scale (not enough detail)
- So we alter it to a 2D plane for convenience using science (math)
- Art is information we include, design , etc.

A **thematic map** shows one or a limited number of types of information, or themes.

# Map Scale
- The relationship between the length measured on a map and the actual distance that length represents on Earth.
- Need map scales to help understand areal distances on maps
- Not perfect because Earth is curved ; will be distortions

$$MAP,SCALE = \frac{MAP,DISTANCE}{EARTH,DISTANCE}$$
## Graphic Map Scale
- line on map, measure with finger, easy to use, 
- Whether enlarging or reading map size, graphic map scales' utility stays the same
![[Pasted image 20240115104719.png]]

## Fractional Map Scale (representative fraction)
- Map distance : Ground Distance
- no units
- 1:50,000   1:1,000,000   1:250,000
- 1:63,360 (denominator equals inches in one mile)

## Verbal Map Scale
- Uses words to give ratio
- One centimetre is equal to ten kilometres (1 cm = 10km)
- 1 inch = mile

# Small and Large Scale Maps

## Small Scale map (> 1:100,000)
• Shows large area (i.e. North America, globe)
• E.g. 1/100,000,000
• Things shown are small
• Few details (generalized)

## Large Scale map (<1:100,000)
• Shows small area (i.e. U of M Campus)
• E.g. 1/10,000
• Things shown are large
• Lots of detail

# Map Projections
- A system in which the spherical surface of Earth is transformed for display on a flat surface
- Inevitable distortion: shape or size
- Three basic types
	1. Cylindrical
	2. Conic
	3. Azimuthal (planar)
![[Pasted image 20240115105406.png]]
Question: What do we want to sacrifice in terms of accuracy?

# Map Properties
**Equivalence:** strive to preserve size  (consistent spacing but might look funny)
**Conformality:** strive to preserve shape  (good angular relationships, odd distances)
**Compromise:** strive to preserve both size and shape

### Challenge of the cartographer
- Equivalence versus conformality dilemma
- Combine geographic exactness of globe with convenience of flat map


# Conformal Maps
- Parallels meridians at 90 degrees
- Preserves the relative shape of landmass
- Distorts the size of landmasses near the poles
- Scale often changes from one area to another (enlarging the high latitudes)
- E.g. Mercator projection (cylindrical projection)
![[Pasted image 20240115110252.png|300]]

# Equivalent Maps
- Preserves the relative size of landmasses
- Distorts the of shape of landmasses near the Poles and Equator
- Advantage: misleading impressions of size avoided
- E.g.: Eckert equal-area projection
![[Pasted image 20240115110349.png|400]]

# Compromise Maps
- Attempt to preserve both equivalence and conformality
- Example: Robinson Projection
![[Pasted image 20240115110444.png|400]]
# Isoline Map
- Continuous spatial data we can connect using an isoline map
- Reveals spatial relationships and geographical patterns

**Isolines:** lines connecting points of equal value on a map
• **Isobars:** atmospheric pressure
• **Isotherms:** temperature
• **Isohyets:** precipitation
• **Contours:** elevation (topographic map)

Example: Isotherm map.

# Topographic Maps
- Roads railways, elevations, rivers, lakes
- 2 dimensional map representing 3 dimensional landscape

- Elevation Contours
- Spot Elevations
