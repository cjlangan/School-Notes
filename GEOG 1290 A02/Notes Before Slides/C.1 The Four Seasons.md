## Learning Objectives
- Describe the nature of Earth’s orbit around the Sun, including revolution, rotation, & axial tilt, & explain the concept of angle of incidence & how it varies by latitude.
- Discuss the seasons with reference to the Equator, the Tropic of Cancer, the Tropic of Capricorn, & the shifting subsolar point.
- Describe how humans experience the Earth–Sun geometric relationship.


# The Shape of Earth
Oblate Spheroid: near-perfect sphere
- Bulge at the Equator - Circumference = 40,075 km
- Flattened at the Poles - Circumference = 40,008 km

Difference is about 1%

# Angle of Incidence
Curvature influences angle of incidence by latitude
- Low latitudes have higher angle of incidence (↑ intensity)
- High latitudes have lower angle of incidence (↓ intensity)

**Subsolar Point:** Sun is directly overhead

# Spatial Reference Points
- Equatorial plane (Equator)
	- Parallel of 0 degrees latitude
- Rotation Axis
- North and South Poles
- Plane of the ecliptic: an imaginary plane that passes through the Sun and every point of Earth’s orbit

# Earth’s orbit around the sun
- Counter clockwise revolution around Sun
	- One full revolution = 365.24 days
	- One rotation = 24 hours
- Elliptical path
	- Perihelion: closest point in orbit (january)
	- Aphelion: farthest point in orbit (July)
![[Pasted image 20240117110111.png]]
- Perihelion is **3.3%** closer than Aphelion

# A Hypothetical Scenario
If the Earth’s axis were perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic:
- the subsolar point would always be at the Equator
- The circle of Illumination would always run directly North-South

- But that's not what actually happens
- Tilt makes poles slightly warmer, 

# The Cause of the Seasons
- The seasons are caused by a combination of rotation, revolution, and tilt/inclination
- Earth’s tilt, known as polarity (or parallelism)
	• the Earth’s axis points towards the North Star (Polaris)
	• Axis is tilted 23.5° from the perpendicular to the plane of ecliptic
	• Axis maintains alignment during orbit around the Sun

# Migration of the Sub-Solar Point
As a result of the combination of factors, the subsolar point migrates throughout the year between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5°N and 23.5° S)

# The Four Seasons
![[Pasted image 20240117110829.png]]

# June Solstice
- North Pole is oriented most directly toward the Sun
- Rays of Sun at noon strike perpendicular to the surface of the **Tropic of Cancer** (23.5° N of the equator)
	- Sub-solar point
- **Arctic circle:** all points North of 66.5° north latitude experience 24 hours of light on this day (all points within 23.5 degrees of the North Pole)
![[Pasted image 20240117111051.png]]

# September and/or March Equinox (AKA autumnal or vernal equinox)
- all latitudes experience 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night
- all latitudes are bisected evenly by the circle of illumination
- Sub-solar point
	- Located at the Equator
![[Pasted image 20240117111138.png]]

# December Solstice (around Dec 21)
- rays of the Sun at noon strike perpendicular to the surface of the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5° S)
- day lengths are longer in the Southern Hemisphere
	- day length is equal at the equator
- Antarctic Circle – all points South of the parallel of 66.5° south latitude experience 24 hours of light

# Global Time
- 24 time zones
	- Each zone covers 15° of longitude (takes Earth 1 hour to rotate that distance)
	- 24 hours for a full rotation of 360°
		- 360°/24 hr = 15°/1 hr
- Prime Meridian (Greenwich, England)
	- Standard 0° for time zone system 
- International Date Line
	- 180° Meridian marks the start and end of each calendar day
	- Asymmetrical zones are the result of politics

# Canadian Time Zones

She says there is an animation on UM Learn good for seasons understanding
