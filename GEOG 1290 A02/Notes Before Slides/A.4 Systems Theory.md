## Learning Objectives
• Explain the concept of a natural system.
• Differentiate between positive & negative feedback.

**SYSTEM:** A collection of things and processes connected together and operating as a whole
- Holistic framework
- Natural systems are greater than the sum of their parts

**Systems Theory:** 
- Ability to analyse and/or describe a group of variables that work together to produce a definable result
- A set of energy inputs create various kinds of predictable outputs

# Systems Approach
***Views earthly processes as assemblages of interrelated and interactive components***

A multivariate area of Geography


# Closed System
• Energy is an input and output, but the system is closed to matter
• Earth is (more or less) a closed system
# Open Systems
• energy and matter are freely exchanged across systems
• Most Earth systems are open systems
# Inputs/Outputs
energy and matter

# Example River System
## Open System
- **inputs:** precipitation (rain or snow), sediment (sand & soil), aquatic life (fish) and energy (sunlight)
- **Outputs:** water flowing out of the river, evaporation (water vapour to the atmosphere), heat energy, sediment, etc

# System response to change
## Positive Feedback
• Initial change will bring additional change in the same direction
• Reinforce/accentuate
- Snowball effect

## Negative Feedback
• initial change will bring about additional change in the opposite direction
• Compensate/regulate
- inhibits system from changing
