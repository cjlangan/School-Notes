# Imaging Earth: Remote Sensing - 2 Kinds
Remote sensing involves measuring properties of the environment without direct contact

## Passive Remote Sensing
- Instruments detect energy emitted from the surface of Earth e.g. a camera

## Active Remote Sensing
- Instruments emit radiation & detect & analyse what is reflected back e.g. radar or sonar
	- Radar emit short pulses towards earth and measures reflected radars, penetrates stuff
	- Sonar, underwater, sound navigation and ranging, emit sound and measure reflections

# Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- GIS is a system for storing, analysing, and manipulating **spatially referenced data**
- GIS databases consist of series of individual data layers
	- Can overlay layers (overlay analysis)
- A data layer contains measurements for a specific geographic variable, such as:
	- Vegetation, soils, road networks, municipal boundaries, and hydrology

- Each layer is assigned a variety of detailed attributes
- Each layer exists as a distinct unit
- For analysis or display, layers are overlaid or combined

# Modelling Earth Processes
- idealized representation of reality
- demonstrate its most important properties
- simplification of a complex reality (generalizations)
