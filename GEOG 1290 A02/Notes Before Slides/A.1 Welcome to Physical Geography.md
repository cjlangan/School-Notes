# Defining Physical Geography
- Greek Meaning "earth description"
- The study of the evolving character of the earth's surface
	- Examines spatial attributes and how they vary
	- Studies interrelationships
- What is where? Why there? Why care?
- Spatial analysis of physical components and natural processes of Earth
	- A way to analyse data that includes information about location about places and their characteristics
- Has two specializations: human and physical geography

***Spatial arrangements, distribution, and organisation***

# The Overlap of Physical and Human Geography

**Anthropogenic Landscapes**: landscapes created or influenced by humans
- Humans modify earth to meet our needs (active force of change)
- all our material goods are connected to natural resources

# Anthropogenic
- Lithium mining in Chileâ€™s Atacama Desert, Jan. 4, 2019

- Chile has largest deposit that makes sense to recover
- Can write about in first assignment

# Subdisciplines of geography and overlap with other disciplines
![[Pasted image 20240110105740.png]]
- Physical Geography on left (blue), Human on the right (brown)
- techniques bridge the two
# ***Geography***
- Looks at how things differ from place to place
- It has no particular body of facts or objects it can call holy its own
- It is a very broad field of inquiry and borrows its objects of study from related disciplines
- It is both a physical science and a social science, and bridges the gap between the two.
- It is interested in interrelationships, both physical and cultural, how they interrelate, and how the interrelate with each of the disciplines
