**3 States**
- Solid, Liquid, Gas
- Water to solid, need to release energy
- solid it gas, need to gain energy

# States of Water on Earth
- Water can exist in all three states at same time in an area
- water, ice, and water in atmosphere

# The Environments of Spheres
**Lithospheres (stone)**
- outer most layer
- beneath ocean floors as well
**Atmosphere (air)**
- gaseous layer surrounding the Earth
- begins few meter within soil 
**Hydrosphere (water)**
- 70% earths surface
- cycles between Lithosphere and Atmosphere
**Biosphere (life)**
- connects all.
