### Sample Paragraph in a Modified APA format

	   Weathering refers to the processes that break rock into smaller fragments and consists of two main categories: chemical and physical, l weathering (United States Geological Survey (USGS), n.d., Weathering section). Chemical weathering is responsible for the large-scale sculpting of the inselbergs in Joshua Tree National Park (JTNP) and refers to the breakup of rock due to changes in chemical composition through exposure to elements such as air, water, and biological processes (Arbogast et al., 2018, p. 388). The rock formations in JTNP were shaped by hydrolysis millions of years ago when the plutonic intrusions were buried deep below the surface.  Increased aridity most likely increases erosion rates and removed the overburden exposing the rounded rock piles (Strudley et al., 2006, Conclusion section, para, 2). Physical and biological weathering continue to play a minor role in shaping the rock piles (Rodgers, 2015, Digging into Joshua Tree's Geology section, para.
