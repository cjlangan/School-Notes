Credible sources are trustable, where the author's ideas are their own and backed by evidence
- **ALWAYS** use credible sources 

Whether a source is credible is dependent on:
- The audience
- The topic
- The discipline
So, what is credible in one course may not be credible in another course

| **CREDIBLE** | **NON-CREDIBLE** |
| ---- | ---- |
| Written by an expert in the field, also edited and fact-<br>checked by other experts<br>Peer-Reviewed journal articles are the MOST credible | Blogs, facebook posts, twitter feeds, other self-<br>authored sites |
| Websites from credible institutions | Research articles without citations/references |
| Materials more recently published (last 10 years).<br>Websites updated recently. | Materials published 15-20 years ago (or longer).<br>Sources that have theories that are out-of-date. |
| Websites with more information, specific purpose, <br>clear audience, unbiased.<br>Websites with an author and date | Websites with minimal information, attempt to<br>persuade. Not regularly updated, unreliable<br>author. |
| Websites ending in .gov or .edu are often good.<br>However still be careful, .edu sites can be started by<br>authors who don't know their material well. | Dictionary sites or encyclopedia sites or Youtube.<br>Wikipedia is not credible; the content changes. |
| Textbooks are usually good. | Course Notes: while we assume course notes<br>are credible they can't be used to cite.<br>You should show you are going beyond course<br>material. |
| There is a clear author whose qualifications can be <br>checked | No author. No date. |
|  | News Sites are typically biased. Non-academic.<br>Non-governmental organisations that are biased. |

## Important Points
- Don't assume search engines produce credible results.
- Google Scholar is helpful, but UM Library is safer and better (full-text access)
- Avoid homepages owned by individuals, unless you can verify credentials
- Is it a wiki? Anyone can modify them. May use as a starting place though.
- Wikipedia is a great source for images, but should not be used as source information

## Common Knowledge
- Don't assume common knowledge, cite it anyway.
