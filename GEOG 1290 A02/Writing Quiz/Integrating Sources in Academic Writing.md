## You can pull information in three ways:
- Summarising
- Paraphrasing
- Quoting
*In all cases you must cite.*

## Summarising and Paraphrasing
- change original sentence (important)
- use quotations around unchanged phrases
- provide clear citation for source for reader

## Putting ideas into your own words
- Focus on understanding the text you're reading
- Take point form notes as you read, rephrasing ideas:
	- What is the author saying?
	- How does it relate to my paper?
- Check that you've changed the words but have kept the meaning
- **Track the source of information so that later you can provide a citation and reference**

## Documenting Sources for Your Reader
1. In the body of your paper, provide an in-text-citation in the body of the paper each time you include information from a source
2. At the end of the paper, provide a full reference for every source used in the paper

## In-Text Citation
- Author + year of publication
- Cite every time information is used

**Examples**
`(Forget, 2011)`
`According to Forget (2011)`

## When directly quoting, also add a page number
`"sample" (Orentlicher, 2018, p. 569)`
`According to Orentlicher (2018), "sample" (p. 569)`

## What Information should be Cited?
- Quotations from the source
- Specific information (statistics)
- Opinions & Theories (other than your own)
- Anything that is not common knowledge

## References
- Each entry begins with author and year of publication

**Example**:
Forget, E. (2011). The town with no poverty: The health effects of a Canadian guaranteed annual income field experiment. *Canadian Public Policy*, 37 (3), 283-305.
       https://doi.org/3842032349-23492934

- The word **References** should be bold and centred at the top
- Sources are sorted alphabetically by the last name of authors
- Double-Space the entire reference list
- Do NOT add extra spaces between entries
- Use "hanging indent" for each reference entry (first line fully left, other tabbed)

## Setting up each entry
- Depends on type of source
	- Book, Journal, Websites, etc.
- Find a model for that type of source, follow it carefully
- APA Handout from UM Libraries
	- 2-Page handout
	- basic information on citing
	- UM Libraries Citing Hub/ APA/ Handout

## Summary
- Citing in APA is a two-part process
- Cite **every time** you use information that is not your own
- Keeping good notes can help make sure you cite accurately
- Paraphrase as much as possible, strongly
