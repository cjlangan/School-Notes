- El Niño, p. 138-139

## Learning Objective
- Discuss how El Niño forms & describe its global effects.

## Chat-GPT
- **El Nino Formation**
	1. Normally: Strong easterly winds push warm water to the western Pacific
	2. El Nino: Weakening easterly winds lead to warm water collecting along the South American coast
- **Global Effects of El Nino**
	1. **Fisheries Impact**
		- Disrupts fishing due to sterile warm waters
		- Depletes nutrient-rich Humboldt Current
	2. **Weather Changes**
		- **South America**
			- Intense storms in dry regions
			- Drought in western Pacific
		- **Southwestern United States**
			- Experiences intense storms
	1. **Atmospheric Pressure and Circulation**
		- Low pressure in eastern Pacific during El Nino
		- High pressure in western Pacific during El Nino
		- Air flows, pushing warm waters to the east side of the Pacific
- **Oceanic Circulation Concepts**
	1. **Normal Equatorial Circulation**
		- Easterly trade winds cause warm waters in the west, upwelling in the east
		- Results in precipitation in the west and dry conditions in the east
	1. **General Oceanic Circulations**
		- Driven by winds, follows atmospheric circulation
		- Gyres exist due to continents
		- Primary consequences is heat redistribution
