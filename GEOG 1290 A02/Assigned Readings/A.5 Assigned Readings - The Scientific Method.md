## Learning Objective
- Describe how the scientific method is used in physical geography

**Will be one question on here on the first test.**


# Typical Steps of the Scientific Method
1. From observation, formulate a question or a problem
2. From the problem, create a hypothesis (testable prediction)
3. Design an experiment for the hypothesis
4. During the experiment: Measure variables, record data (hypothesis testing)
5. Analyse the data, decide if the hypothesis is false
6. Draw conclusions. Publish data, or reject methods/results.  Make new hypothesis.
7. If hypothesis survives repeated testing, it may contribute to a *theory*

# **Theory:**
- Best scientific explanation for a group of facts.
- Highest order of scientific understanding
- Can be modified over time

## Example:
- We *know* the Earth revolves around the Sun because of the heliocentrism theory.
- Previously, we *knew* the Earth was the centre of the universe

# Geography Example:
- Test hypothesis that water ins streams within a certain region is acidic
- Collect samples from a number of streams and determine acidity

# Other things Geographer might test hypothesis on
- atmosphere
- rocks
- soils
- ice
- cores
- satellite images
- Earth's magnetic field
- other planets
