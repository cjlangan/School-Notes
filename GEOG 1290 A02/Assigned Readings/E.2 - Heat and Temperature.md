# The Flow of Solar Radiation on Earth

## **Explain the difference between heat and temperature.**
- **Heat** is a form of energy related to the motion of atoms and molecules. It can be transferred between objects or substances
- **Temperature** is a measure of average kinetic energy of the particles of a substance. It gives an indication of how hot or cold a substance is

## Describe the four ways heat moves
- **Radiation**: Involves the creation of electromagnetic waves carrying energy, which can move form one place to another without requiring a medium
- **Conduction**: This involves the diffusion of energy through molecules that are in direct contact with each other. It occurs because, as the temperature of molecules increases, they vibrate more rapidly, causing collisions and transferring heat
- **Convection**: This involves the upward movement of heat. For example, in the context of boiling water, a circular current is formed where hot water moves up and is replaced by cooler water at the bottom. Convection is associated with large-scale movement of matter.
- **Advection**: The horizontal movement of air or fluid, transferring heat horizontally. It is an essential component of atmospheric circulation.

## Identify how air temperature is measured and the significance of the humidex and wind chill index
*Air temperature is typically measured using a thermometer. The reading on the thermometer provides the temperature of the air*
- **Humidex**: measure of how hot the weather feels when relative humidity is factored in with the air temperature. 
- **Wind Chill Index**: measure of how cold the air feels when wind speed is factored in with the actual air temperature.
