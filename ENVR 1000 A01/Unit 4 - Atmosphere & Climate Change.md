# Component Parts of Earth's Climate Change
- 4 Spheres and the sun
- Sun is main driver
- Water is crucial in all stages
- 70% of earth's surface is ocean
- atmosphere is protective blanket, ozone protects radiation
- forest converts energy, change climate

# Incoming Radiation - The Electromagnetic Spectrum

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240209113909.png)

- Role of atmosphere is to screen out shortwave radiation like ultraviolet
- Infrared radiation is heat, not harmful, long wave, leaves earth(outgoing)
- visible light (incoming) used for photosynthesis
	- plant leaves green because chlorophyl, uses reds and blues, but not green
		- Green light is reflected back at use, plant doesn't use green
		- but absorbs others --> absorbs heat
- Black T-shirt absorbs, white reflects (cooling)
- Planet doesn't absorb the infrared, it absorbs visible light, colour depicts how much colour is absorbed

# The atmosphere has distinct layers and provides numerous services essential to life
- **Thermosphere**: aurora borealis, gamma rays and x-rays absorbed (heated)
- **Mesosphere**: temperature dropping
- **Stratosphere**: ozone layer (absorbs UV radiation, generates heat), pollution(CFC)
- **Troposphere**: life

Pause: boundary, no change in temperature


# Earth’s Energy Budget

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240209115715.png)

- 70% energy is absorbed,  30% reflected
	- atmosphere is 20% absorbed, 20% reflected
- 6% land surface contributes to reflection
- Greenhouse gases play their role on the outgoing side of the relationship where they absorb heat
- 47% absorbed by land and ocean
	- land is 6-10% reflected, 50% absorbed
# Not All Surfaces Are Equal in Energy Absorption/Reflection - Albedo
- **Albedo** is a measure of the **reflectivity** of the Earth’s surfaces
- Light coloured surfaces have highest albedo because they reflect more energy than they absorb; dark coloured surfaces, vegetation and oceans have low albedo because they absorb more than they reflect

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240209120145.png)

- oceans: 5% reflected
- Heat Island --> warm over city/ human activity
- Chlorofil does not absorb green

# Incoming Solar Radiation – Influenced by the curvature and axis of inclination

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240209120947.png)

- More intense sunlight (smaller illumination) at equator than poles that leads to a **temperature gradient and seasonal differences with latitude**
	- winds

# More intense sunlight (smaller illumination) at equator than poles that leads to a temperature gradient and seasonal differences with latitude

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240209121127.png)

- Atmosphere and oceans redistribute heat
- Greenhouse gases like a blanket, don't let heat escape
- energy leaving earth is longwave infrared radiation
- Organism (humans, earth) emit heat loss to the atmosphere (heat = infrared)
- Hot air rise = rain   at equator tropical forest and 60 degrees north at boreal forest
- Cold air, fall = dry,   deserts, Antarctic is driest, cuz convection

# The Atmosphere Radiates IR or Heat
- The atmosphere radiates the equivalent of incoming sunlight back to space as heat (IR). This includes:
	- Energy that was absorbed by the atmosphere (particles, clouds, ozone)
	- Energy that was transferred to the atmosphere from the Earth’s surface by evaporation and phase changes in water, conduction/convection, and thermal infrared radiation/latent heat.
- What happens to this heat heading back out to space?
	- Greenhouse Gases absorb a portion of this IR in the troposphere
	- Some of the thermal infrared energy escapes to space through a “window” effect

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240212114636.png)

- Evaporation = cooling, heat going to atmosphere
	- oceans will also get saltier from evaporation

# Convective Currents Help to Redistribute Heat Energy

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240212115009.png)

- Warm air less dense, more energy, move more,   High --> Low pressure

# 6 Giant Convection Cells Distribute Heat Toward Poles and Contribute to Long Range Transport

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240212115240.png)

- Warm air at the equator rises and cooler air at the poles descends.
	- So, low pressure = warm and humid and rain
- Precipitation patterns leads to arid bands at defined latitudes.

# Redistribution of Heat by the Thermohaline Gradient (Ocean Conveyor Belt)
- Thermohaline = heat salt, gradient = difference
- Driven by temperature and salinity differences
- Water changes to ice at polar regions and expels salts
- The colder denser water sinks to the sea floor pushing water
- In other areas of the ocean, upwelling brings nutrients back to the surface

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240212120417.png)

- gives heat to Europe (hot body to atmosphere), moves cuz heat and winds, this heat generates evaporation, which generates more salty and heavy water
- The salty water in the arctic is now cold and create a huge waterfall
	- Need cold and salty water, it is dense
- melting glaciers make the water less salty, affecting conveyor belt

Upwelling, when conveyor belt heads toward landmass it rises
- this recycles important nutrients for plants and animals


# Outgoing IR is Absorbed/Re-emitted By Gases in the Atmosphere (Greenhouse Gases)
- Greenhouse gases are like a blanket, keep heat in
- 4 blankets, one naturally occurring and good, 3 are human caused
- Natural:
	- Composed of water, corban dioxide, and others
	- water vapour is largest contributor to warming influence : 65%
	- Carbon dioxide is 25%
- Human / Cultural:
	- Carbon dioxide blanket
	- CH4 and N2O blanket, and bad Ozone
		- CH4 (methane), like from cattle, 
			- **high decomposition without oxygen = methane**
			- Only get halfway through decomposition reaction, not enough oxygen
			- Hydro is a major source of methane
			- Methane is 25x more powerful than carbon dioxide
		- N2O (nitrous oxide)
			- bacteria on land with ammonia creates it
			- 200-300x more powerful than carbon dioxide
	- CFC (chlorofluorocarbon)
		- in fridges, synthetic chemical
		- eat away ozone
		- 5000x more powerful than carbon dioxide

# Today We Are In A State of Positive Radiative Forcing – Net increase in energy and temperature

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240216115941.png)

# Vostok Ice Cores Help to Reveal How GHG Concentrations Varied Pre-Historically
- Ice cores trap gases as they form and samples can be extracted for analysis
- 3600 meter core equates to 400,000 years ago.
- Ice cores also yield information about precipitation and temperature.

*When CO2 is plotted with temperature, there is a strong correlation over 4 cycles.*

# Trends in Carbon Dioxide Concentrations – Modern Measurements

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240216120339.png)

- zig zag on annual basis from seasons, less CO2 in summer cuz photosynthesis

**Positive Radiative Forcing** – Net increase in energy and temperature results because of the energy imbalance between “what’s coming in from the Sun and what’s leaving from the surface and atmosphere

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240226114946.png)

- cant exceed 2 degree anomaly

# Effects of Human-Induced Changes in the Climate Budget
- Energy imbalance means more of the outgoing infrared radiation is trapped in the lower atmosphere
- Interactions of this trapped energy leading to pronounced changes in the ecosystem
	- **Severe Weather** - Patterns and Occurrences
	- **Biosphere** – increase loss of species, change in distribution
	- **Pedosphere/Lithosphere** – Soil degradation and loss of agricultural production
	- **Cryosphere** (frozen water) and **Hydrosphere** – patterns in snow and ice melt; severe weather etc.

# Arctic Amplification Relates to Ice-Albedo and Positive Feedback

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240226115316.png)

# Arctic amplification has resulted in >4oC annual temperature and far greater than anywhere else on the planet

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240226115404.png)

- Affects albedo, decreases, exposed water absorbs more, positive feedback

# Arctic Amplification is Driven By and Resulting In Changes in the: 
- **Sea Ice** – leads to a reduction in albedo and but reveals the underlying water that will rapidly warm because of positive feedback. This has driven the temperature anomaly now observed
- **Greenland Ice Sheet** – land-based ice that discharges freshwater into the Arctic ocean. The addition of this water is causing sea level to rise and concerns that the ocean conveyor speed will decline. Ocean circulation will be significantly reduced that will cool Europe and reduce fish production.
- **Permafrost Soils** – melting of the ice deep in soil profiles contributes to collapsing soils, production of carbon dioxide and likely methane. The latter would result in pronounced and rapid warming everywhere else on the planet

# Sea Ice

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240226120713.png)

- Extent of Arctic Ocean covered by ice is about ½ by the end of the animation (and therefore greater ocean absorption and heating)
- Thicker/old aged ice is attacked and thinned that would typically stabilize ice sheet when wave action could sheer ice into smaller pieces.
- End result – rapid warming; ice free Arctic Ocean projected in summer months.

# Greenland (and Antarctic) Ice Sheets
- Land-based ice sheets
- melting adding about 2 mm sea level rise annually with estimates of 3 feet already committed but could increase with severity of melt
- Extreme flooding and risk must consider:
	- environmental refuges from islands and coastal regions
	- loss of important ecosystems flooded by salty water
	- changes to the ocean circulation affecting not only redistribution of heat but also ocean productivity of marine ecosystems
- Concern of incredible sea level rise should the Antarctic ice melt

## Outcomes:
- Greenland ice sheet melting and discharging freshwater; calving ice at a faster rate
- Committed sea level rise of 3 m projected to 6 m that will result in catastrophic losses in coastal regions

# Permafrost Melt
- *Carbon Emission (permafrost will no longer be a sink for carbon storage but a source!)*
- land is slumping and rates of soil erosion are alarming
- Potential for enormous amounts of CH4 and CO2 to be released that will lead to “run-away” climate change for the rest of the world

# Positive Feedback – Release of Carbon Dioxide and Methane in the Arctic

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240228121651.png)

- Twice as much carbon is stored deep in permafrost soils as is present in the atmosphere
- Warming soils accelerates decomposition that releases CO2 and methane
- Expect a positive feedback response contributing increasing amounts of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere!

# What are the impacts to us?
With a rapidly warming Arctic (and Antarctic) how will this
cause problems for Humanity?
- we have warmer oceans......causing?
- we have more water in the oceans......leading to?
- we have more moisture in the atmosphere.....causing?
- we have more rapid melting of snow packs and glaciers
- more heat in the atmosphere.....leading to?

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240228121824.png)

# What Can We Do?
- Paris Agreement
- Individual actions
- Opportunities in technologies?
- Landscape alterations that alter carbon uptake/sequestration
