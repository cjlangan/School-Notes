# Biodiversity
- Variety of life in all its forms, levels, and combinations within an area

- Diversity is generally defined on four fronts:   **(LEGS)**
	- **L**andscapes
	- **E**cosystems/habitats
	- **G**ene pool
	- **S**pecies and *three components(evenness, richness, and dominance)*

- Biodiversity is linked to the goods and services we rely on to fulfil our requirements

*forests have the most biodiversity, ground, tree, etc.  Chop it down, it is gone*
*we rely on the diversity of species in our world, future*

## What are the five reasons biodiversity is important to us? (Will be on test)
1. **Economic value**
	- fish, timber
- **Ecological life support**
	- Services it provides, water purification, oxygen
- **Cultural value**
	- Indigenous paintings, historic culture, kangaroo, bison
- **Recreational Value**
	- Leisure, walk in parks, swim in lakes, go to beaches
- **Scientific Value**
	- Pursuit of knowledge, cancer care, NASA
	
**Negative value**:  Diseases, killed by crocodiles

### We Must: 
- address biodiversity decline
- understand complexity 
- inform resource use discussions
### Ecosystem Management
- Community involvement
- Public involved

# How Many Species Are There?
- Estimates of total number range from 3.6 to 100 million species, around 10 mil
	- Canada has 160,000 species, because weather

## Four factors contribute to variations in species diversity: (GLAS)
- **Geographic isolation** reduces biodiversity by limiting gene dispersal
	- Cut forest, roads, city
- **Latitudinal Gradient** - Biodiversity is greatest at the equator and declines with latitude and is associated with climatic stability in temperature and precipitation
	- Moderate temperatures towards equator.  Higher latitude = lower biodiversity
- **Age of the ecosystem** - tropical regions are “older” because they did not undergo glaciation and this has promoted the evolution of new species
	- Ice age kill diversity.  Older = more biodiversity
- **Structural complexity of the ecosystem** – forests offer more ecological niches than grasslands
	- Squirrel in forest vs. in grassland

*Age from ice ages, not higher latitudes being colder*

# How Do Scientists Evaluate Biodiversity within Ecosystems?
### Require Three Measurements:
- **Species Richness:** # of species
- **Species Evenness**: # individuals per species
- **Dominance**: is there more of any one species
![[Pasted image 20240129114713.png]]![[Pasted image 20240129114723.png]]
- Richness: same
- Evenness: different
- Dominance: bottom ecosystem is dominant
**Conclusion:** Top has more biodiversity

# Ecological Niche
**Ecological Niche** represents a multi-dimensional view of **everything** an organism does:
- Adaptations to live in water, fly or run on the savannah
- Use of resources
- Interactions with other organisms
- Lifestyle

*Organisms cannot live in complete isolation and will be influenced by others. The individuals whether in the same or different species must compete for their resources.*

*If they have exactly the same needs, one species will outcompete and lead to the exclusion of others*

*To minimize this competition species will alter aspects of their ecological niche. This is called **resource partitioning***
![[Pasted image 20240129115750.png]]
Fundamental Niche: Where species could theoretically use resources
Realised Niche: Where they must use resources because of competition

*Specialist ALWAYS vulnerable to extinction, like Panda*
*Generalist: wide range (lives everywhere, does what it wants, eats whatever)*

# Symbiosis - Mutualism
- Sharing benefit
*Bee feeds on nectar to acquire food and in so doing it is covered by pollen that can be transported to the next flower and contribute to pollination*

# Symbiosis - Commensalism
- One species benefits, other not affected
*Barnacles on whales*

# Symbiosis - Parasitism
- Parasite benefits, host is "harmed"
*Ticks*

# Predation
- Consumption of one species by another
- Elaborate predator-prey strategies develop
	- Nocturnal behaviour
	- Live in social groups
	- Mechanical and chemical defences
	- Camouflage

### The Importance of Species to Ecosystems
# Keystone Species
- Impact on ecosystem is massive (nutrients, physical), more than expected
- If removed, there is an expected substantial change to the ecosystem
- Analogy to stone piece (keystone)
- Can be any type of organism (anywhere on food chain)
![[Pasted image 20240131115044.png]]

### Example - Prairie Dogs are a Keystone Species
- Burrow in ground
	- Brings up nutrients and seeds buried in ground
	- Productivity increase, diversity increases
	- Burrow dens become home for other species
- Herbivore
	- eat plants to spread seeds and nutrients
- Food for Carnivores
	- Needed to be eaten

# Wolves of Yellowstone National Park - In-class video
How influence biosphere, physical processes (erosion, flow rates)

Watch the video and find examples of the over-arching influence of the wolves of Yellowstone National Park on:
- Populations and Communities
- Nutrient cycling
### Notes
- tree height,
- birds came
- beavers built dams
- otter, fish etc.
- less coyotes, number of rabbit, more eagle, bears, more berries
- Bears kill some wolf cubs
- changes river, meander less, more pools, 
	- forests stabilises banks, less erosion, less deer and more vegetation mean soil erosion
*Keystone because we could tell from before an after affect, typically we only realise when a species is remove.  We know prairie dogs are a keystone species because we removed them for agriculture and then realised degradation*

# Measuring Species through Population Dynamics
- **A population is ONE species** 
- Dense population, waste, then disease
- Take all of their food source, geese destroy soil

# Factors Affecting Population – Size and Growth Rate
### Population Growth Rate
- The percentage increase in a population over a period of time
- birth rate, immigration ; deaths, emigration
![[Pasted image 20240202113240.png]]
### Doubling Time
- The ***time*** needed for a population to double its size assuming the growth rate remains the same.
- 5% takes 14 years to double population.  That's high.

# Growth Patterns in Populations
### Exponential Growth - Increases by a fixed percentage (rate of growth) over time (hours; years)
- Takes on J-shaped in which it is slow at the start (lag) and then a small change in time results in a dramatic increase in population size
	- Think couple getting comfortable in new home first then later breed in the ideal conditions
- Characteristic of small rapidly growing species such as bacteria and fungi
- Requires ideal environmental conditions to promote the rapid growth

### Logistic Growth Pattern
- Population first grows at exponential rate but then slows as one or several environmental factors become limiting
- Population no long increases in size.
- The number of individuals remains relatively constant after this point (carrying capacity)
![[Unit 3 - Biodiversity and Management 2024-02-02 11.35.54.excalidraw]]

## Carrying capacity 
- Maximum number of individuals that can live in an environment
- Healthy environment = high carrying capacity
- doesn't stay the same.
- If population below capacity = stability.

## Answer the Following
- What are the habitat and ecosystem requirements for the snow geese and how do these influence population dynamics?
- What is/are the limiting factor(s) to snow geese populations?
	- food, predators
- Why does the population continue to grow exponentially regardless of the limiting factor?
	- humans, farms, remove predators
- What are the consequences of unrestricted population growth?
	- Decreased carrying capacity
	- Indigenous have less food
- What does the population growth curve appear as? Can you identify the carrying capacity, population overshoot and die back?
- What evidence is there that the population has exceeded its carrying capacity?
	- Mudflats
	- Different vegetation
