# Ecosystem Management is a Decision-Making Tool
- allows society to achieve societal goals
- How we implement sustainable development
- Is directly connected to the concepts of sustainability through the integration of:
	- ecological,
	- social, and
	- economic components
- Achieving societal goals in a defined geographic area for the interacting biotic communities and their abiotic attributes
	- Note that humans are a component of any ecosystem
- Used to enhance environment decision-making in societies best interest

# 12 Principles - 3 Important
- **Management with a focus on societal choices** 
	- e.g., Should we develop the natural resource or preserve it? Should we prioritize conservation due to species at risk?
- **All encompassing in knowledge and inclusion of information** 
	- not just scientific perspectives but Indigenous, Metis, Inuit; farmers and local land owners, foresters etc.
- **Everyone should be included and has a voice**

# 12 Principles are Developed Into 5 Steps (A-E)
**Step A:** Determining the main stakeholders, defining the ecosystem area, and developing the relationship between them
**Step B:** Characterizing the structure and function of the ecosystem, and
setting in place mechanisms to manage and monitor it
**Step C:** Identifying the important economic issues that will affect the
ecosystem and its inhabitants
**Step D:** Determining the likely impact of the ecosystem on adjacent
**Step E:** Deciding on long-term goals, and flexible ways of reaching them

*Steps A & B most important*

# Step A: Geographic Boundary
- **Jurisdictional basis** – map with subdivision
	- e.g. Canada represents the management area; Province of Manitoba
- **Administrative basis** – districts/sub-zones within the province – conservation districts where there might be unique goals and objectives/priorities; a national or provincial park
	- national parks use administrative boundary
- **Ecological basis** – defined based on the ecological features
	- terrestrial; aquatic; species specific
	- more holistic
- **Combination of the above** – check out Royal-wood example from the textbook
	- combination of priorities/objectives

# Step A - Identifying Stakeholders
- Government Agencies
	- National
	- Regional (State/Provincial)
	- Local
- Non-Government Organizations (NGO’s)
- Business/Industry
- Residents of Cities, Towns, Villages
- Indigenous/Cultural/Religious Components
- Others
- Organized into Primary (Local Residents), Secondary (Government) and Tertiary (NGO) Stakeholders

# Step B – Describe Features and Relate to Goals
- Characterize the main biotic/abiotic features of the ecosystem with stakeholders
	- Joint mapping, ground-truthing, exploratory walks
- Decide on management objectives as these relate back to the ecosystem structural and functional features
- Use baseline information from surveys of the ecosystem but also available knowledge from all stakeholders (builds trust)

# Step C – What are the Key Economic Considerations
- Try to eliminate negative economic incentives (high taxes, environmental damages)
- Create positive economic incentives (subsides in beneficial development, awards, reduced taxes)

# Step D - Adaptive Management
- What's happening to the adjacent ecosystems?
	- Minimise negative impacts

# Step E - Over Time...
- Create long-term goals and flexible ways of reaching them

# Canadian National Parks
- Country-wide system of representative natural areas
- protected by law, public understanding and appreciation are key BUT ecological integrity is maintained for the future
- **Ecological Integrity** means keeping ecosystems healthy and whole - a state where biodiversity, structure, and functions are unimpaired and will persist
	- Historical shift from ***monumentalism*** (gape in awe)

# Case Study: Riding Mountain National Park (RMNP) in Manitoba
- can't have ecological integrity
- considered a biosphere reserve
- elk live in fragmented habitat (interactions between elk and cattle are problematic)
	- elk have pathogen (Bovine Tuberculosis), cattle will die
	- elk see good food off of park

## Problem - RMNP is an Ecological Island
- Duck Mountain Provincial Park north of it
- Lots of vegetation there compared to surrounding area
- genetic inbreeding
- need to let them migrate

*Ecological islands can be trees surrounded by crops, or roads disconnecting areas*

# Park Biologists (Have) Estimated the Minimum Viable Population (MVP) to Conserve Biodiversity
- MVP - smallest population that can maintain itself and its genetic variability indefinitely
- carrying capacity not necessarily the objective
- Researchers tracked elk to determine habitat range requirements and MVP
- Conclusion: Elk utilize more than protected area; engage with cattle in private lands, also in duck mountain
	- So, doesn't meet ecological integrity, not enough area for elk in RMNP

# How to Solve the Problem (1): ‘safe passage’ by creating wildlife and conservation corridors
- corridors to connect fragmented pieces

# Solve the Problem (2): Establish buffer zones and biosphere reserves
- diverging interests
- Create buffer zone around protected areas, where everyone works together
	- zone of cooperation: functionally extending area of the park

# RMNP Biosphere Reserve: 
- Cattle are relocated to government/crown land and public pastures to remove the threat of TB transfer between elk and cattle Park “behaves as though boundaries were extended an additional 12,000 km2 (black border).
	- fixing ecological integrity

# Outcomes of the RMNP Biosphere Reserve
- RMNP was able to maintain the ecological integrity of elk by allowing the animals to freely travel from the core area of the park to the Duck Mountains.
- The minimum viable population has been successfully maintained in the face of potential conflict.
- The landowners who were affected by bovine tuberculosis were able to move the cattle away from the high-risk areas.
- The First Nations representatives were able to satisfy their cultural pursuits by harvesting more elk around the park area

***KNOW HOW MANAGEMENT STEPS WERE USED IN STUDY***

# National versus Provincial Parks
- **Provincial Parks Use a Model of Conservation**
	- Use a model based on the three pillars of SD: environment, social well-being, economic development
- **Federal Parks use a Model of Preservation**
	- Protects species or landscapes without reference to Human interests
	- Uses a **historical reference** to identify the features worthy of preserving
		- looks at past to see what to preserve, or goal
- **We see this difference in management philosophy as well:**
	- Federal Parks are limited in how tourism activities develop, cottage and recreational development is quite restricted; forestry, mining, and other resource extraction excluded from federal parks
	- Provincial parks will entertain all of these activities when it is deemed to be in Society’s interest to do so. In some circumstances (e.g., species at risk), the protection of the species is a priority and other activities are excluded. Parks could be designated as wilderness only.


# Population Loss - Major Threats to Biodiversity Leading to Extinction
- **Anthropocene Era**: Humans are responsible for the 6th mass extinction of biodiversity
- **Major Threats to Biodiversity include:**
	- overhunting, poaching and overfishing
	- air, water, and soil pollution
	- loss of habitat and fragmentation of existing habitat
	- climate change
	- introduced species that share the same ecological niche and able to outcompete
	- human population and overconsumption

# Why are Some Species More Vulnerable Than Others?
- Long Lived and Delayed Maturity
- Low Reproductive Rates
- Limited Habitat Availability and Challenged to Establish New Locations
- Breed in Colonies - high density at seasonal times
- Specific Requirements at Life Stage - example is hibernating
- Niche specialisation

# Animal Species in Trouble - Not tested on
![[Pasted image 20240308121048.png]]

# Biodiversity Conservation
- Internationally   **IUCN**, Convention on Biological Diversity
	- if IUCN classifies as endangered then so does Canada
- Canada, Biodiversity Strategy (SARA)
	- Provincially, endangered species act

*For sustainable development*

# International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
- Report status of species, endangered, health of biosphere
- How humans interact with species
	- Reported through Red List

*SARA stuff is important*
# Canada's Species At Risk Act (SARA)
- To **prevent** Canadian indigenous species, subspecies, and distinct populations from becoming extirpated or extinct
- To provide for **recovery** of endangered or threatened species
- To encourage **management** of other species to prevent them from becoming at risk

# SARA Categories
- **Extinct** - A species that no longer exists.
- **Extirpated** - A species no longer existing in the wild in Canada, but occurring elsewhere. Could be province, or region as well
- **Endangered** - A species facing imminent extirpation or extinction.
- **Threatened** - A species likely to become endangered if limiting factors are not reversed.  **This is where recovery strategy comes into play**
- **Special Concern** – A species particularly sensitive to human activities or natural events

# RENEW Canada Program
**(Recovery of Nationally Endangered Wildlife in Canada)**
- Component of SARA, to assist species to recover population sizes
- Unique to SARA, other nations may not have recovery management

### Woodland Caribou
- Roads allows deer and wolves into caribou area, so removed them
- encourage liken production in forestry
- Collared them to track, life stages, what they eat, disease.
- Stakeholders were indigenous, government, industry, feds, NGO's (non governmental organisations)

*will ask about Wimby international park, mountain gorilla and woodland caribou, and Great Bear Rainforest*

Step A: Geographic locations included, stakeholders
Step B: Features/characteristics, abiotic & biotic environment


# Invasive Species
- No natural predators
- outcompetes native species
- changes features of ecosystems (food web, physical processes)
- Kill biodiversity
- Originate from humans (ex plane)
- Economic losses
- Health concerns
- Recreational losses

# Canada Particularly Vulnerable to Invaders from Southern USA
- Geographically, it is not difficult to transport invaders because the Mississippi watershed is in close proximity to the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay basins
- Public education is critical to stopping invaders at borders

# Aquatic Invaders Came to North America Through Ship Ballast
- Cargo tankers take on water in their country of origin
- Ballast water stabilizes the ship
- Ship dumps ballast water at destination (Great Lakes)
- Around five billion tonnes of water, carrying a multitude of micro- organisms, eggs, larvae and larger organisms, are now transported annually as ballast

# What is a Forest Ecosystem?
- Plant community dominated by trees and woody plants, shrubs, 
- vertical layers, floor, canopy
- Biodiversity, filter air, freshwater, build soils

# Forest Regions in Canada
- Boreal Forest (70% of Canada)
	- little scrubby trees, wildfires, outcroppings(boulders)
	- Coniferous trees (Christmas), needles affect soils
- Deciduous Forest (South)
	- Leaves that fall, affects soils increase fertility
- Coastal Rainforest (West) (video)
	- Old growth temperate rainforest

# Stresses to Canada's Forests
- Logging
	- Harvesting previously uneconomical trees
	- Cumulative impacts
	- Threatens biodiversity
- Mining
- Hydroelectric development
- Climate change (pine beetle)
- Acid precipitation (particularly for deciduous trees)

# Forest Types
## Secondary growth
- Regenerating forest after natural disturbances or forestry operations (10-50-100 years)
- Trees more closely spaced
- Rapid growth on forest floor, cuz of successional stage
- Less biodiversity than Old Growth, one canopy layer, fewer niches
## Old Growth
- Really old 100-500 years
- Matured to end stage, not much more growth
- Unique biological features
	- large live trees
	- large dead trees
	- Large logs on forest floor
- Multiple vertical layers, different trees species in some cases
- Tremendous number of ecological niches for biodiversity

# Harvesting (Silvicultural) Systems
## Clear Cut
- Mow everything down
- Forests have **even-aged** structure
## Selective Cut
- Figuring out what you want to take, size, quality
- Safe zone for wildlife
- forest regenerates naturally
- **Uneven-aged forest** is maintained
	- old and young trees

# 
- Woodland caribou need 65% of boreal forest
- UofM researcher theorised if we could cut forest block such that it seemed like a wildfire, then the caribou would be fine, cuz caribou were used to it
- Found where all forest fires took place for 60 years 
![[Pasted image 20240315115336.png]]
- Green is corridor retention
- Yellow is island retention
- Red is what you can cut
- Showed that forest won't recover the same way as a wildfire; no ash to stimulate growth
- so, they strip the tree branches and bark to decompose
- For some trees, the fire stimulates the seeds, thus growth
