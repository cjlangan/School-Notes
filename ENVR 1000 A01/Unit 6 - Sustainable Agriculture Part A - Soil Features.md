# Soil Features
- **Soil**: a stew of geological ingredients (parent rocks and minerals), water, and billions of organisms
	- is not dirt
## Soil Aggregates/Structure
- Physical features – particle size, aggregate structure that makes soils clump and crumble 
- Provide sufficient movement of air, water and nutrient mobility
## Soil Fertility - ability to grow crops long term
- need clump and crumble, not solely one
- Darker is better, implies organic matter
- Nutrients (N, P, K, and micronutrients) as well as organic matter from dead organisms, and pH

# Soil Components
## Soil Tilth
- balance between physical features
	- moisture and ability for water to infiltrate
	- degree of aeration that promote health root
- 4 major components:
	- Soil organic matter (SOM) - 5%
	- minerals - 45%
	- water - 25%
	- air - 25%

- SOM is crucial for fertility, and has been decreasing
	- farming practices not recycling nutrients

# Soils - Features and Formation
- O horizon 
	- partially decomposed
	- mostly organic
- A horizon
	- a lot more decomposition (dark black, humus)
	- Leaching; rain brings nutrients deeper
- B horizon
	- zone of accumulations of material from layer A
	- grey-brown
	- sub soil
- C horizon
	- weathered rocks
	- groundwater
- Consolidated Bedrock

# Soil Texture
- Different particle sizes
	- **Sand** - high **porosity**; water and air moves through 
	- **Silt** - in between
	- **Clay** - compact tight, no porosity, holds soils together
- Want 1/3 of each

**Clod**: soil so compacted that its unusable, like cement
- clay more likely to from clods

# Soil Structure - Physical Condition
- **Aggregate Stability**:
	- How well mixed our soil is
	- Want clump but also crumble
	- If mix too much you will separate the particles
		- risk of **erosional processes** and **crusting**
			- limits water penetration
			- Runoff, fertilizer into rivers
	- want sufficient pore space

# Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)
- **Negatively charged clay** and organic material "hold" minerals in the Soil (Mg, K, P . . .)
- Important to **slow flow of leaching**, so minerals don't go too deep
- Clay found in B horizon, holds nutrients for plants
- Acidic soils have H+, accelerate nutrient loss cuz have preferential binding to clay

*Acid Rain = Deplete soils of nutrients*

# Soil Ecosystem - Soil Organic Matter (SOM)
- “When we are standing on the ground, we are really standing on the roof top of another world”
- Living in the soil are plant roots, viruses, bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoa, mites, nematodes, worms, ants, maggots and other insects and insect larvae (grubs), and larger animals.
- Crucial to fertility, stabilises soil aggregates, improving soil structure, and tilth
- Humus consists of chains of carbon molecules with a large surface area; these surfaces carry electrical charges, which attract and hold mineral particles

*Symbiosis - Mutualism*

# Biotic Associations Found in Soils
- e.g., Symbiosis, N2 Fixation
- Roots colonised by fungi
- create internal network
- exchange sugars and nutrients
- fungi expand elsewhere, drawing in more nutrients
- 700x more area to assist with
- Mycorrhizal Fungi, symbiosis

# Soil Food Web
- Begins with plants above ground
- things we do impact it all

# Soil Ecosystem Services
- Increasing fertility through the build up of organic matter and symbiotic interactions
- Reduction in soil erosion and huge increase in water holding capacity
- Breakdown of toxins by decomposing community
- Enhanced carbon storage and long term storage (sequestration)
- Soil ecosystem dynamics heavily influenced by agricultural activities and climate
- How can temperature and precipitation determine soil organic matter?
