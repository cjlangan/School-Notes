- Need 85% for A+
- University Centre 210-224
- Sit down by A01 or A02
- 50 one mark questions
- one short answer, 10 marks - From last third of course
- Sections that overlap will be most crucial, but generally cumulative
	- Nitrogen fixations, decomposition
	- Not incredible detail on stuff in first two sections
		- like don't know all aspects of all the cycles
		- know that bacteria makes nitrogen unique
		- shouldn't be lots of phosphorus in water, hungry plants, helps water areas
- Study session April 23 at 10:00 over Zoom


# Enviro-Jeopardy
- Steps in sewage treatment: primary remove chunks, secondary remove organics so not a lot of decomposition so oxygen isn't depleted (oxygen sag) (measure by BOD spike), tertiary disinfection(remove pathogens) & remove nutrients to avoid eutrophication
- Gulf stream take mercury from NA to the Arctic
- Tillage creates aggregate structure, reducing infiltration, separates particles sizes, air spaces crucial for respirations, black soil absorbs sunlight and warms for bacteria - good, better to have not till and cover crop
- Clay retains water and reducing leaches away nutrients, so high cation exchange (nutrient rich soil), acidified soils have low cation exchange, want 5% soil organic matter but deadly in water, plants on top are base of soil food web, plants secrete sugars for soils for fungi and benefit plants (symbiosis), nitrogen fixation also symbiosis
- Traps, predators, to removes pests, pesticide last resort, if kill more than target that is called indirect effects (like honeybees, bald eagles)
