# Review
- Test practice questions
-  overshoot day dec 31
	- most people is June/May, meaning using future generation or other country
- Perpetual resources / alternative energies, same thing
- Renewable, 
- Biocapacity is supply, demand is ----,    overshoot is supply < demand
- Scientific method steps
	- control flower, manipulated/tested flower
- environment is a system: carbon cycle
- positive vs. negative feedback, 
	- Positive: respiration, decomposition, forest fires
	- Negative: photosynthesis
- Nitrogen cycle: bacteria   .   Know all steps
- Humans reliant on bacteria: ammonia --> nitrates
- Know two bacteria: rhizobium (mutualism, legumes?, ), cyanobacteria (water)
- Phosphorus, no atmosphere, patchy, rocks & plants, absorbed in roots
	- physical process like carbon cycle, 
- Nitrate must become ammonia to be used first
- Humans cant wait, so we use industrial fixation, pollution, greenhouse gases
- Energy in one direction, materials recycle (carbon)
- First law --> plants ultimate transformers, sugars
- second law --> few trophic levels. energy loss to heat, pyramid of energy (not many to predators)
- plants are autotrophs, cuz not reliant on others
- Ecological niche, everything to know about organism
	- resource partitioning to reduce competition
