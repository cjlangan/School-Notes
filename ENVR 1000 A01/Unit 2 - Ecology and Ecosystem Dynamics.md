# Ecological Principles
- Ecology is described as the study of one's house
- Interactions of living and non-living components
- Focus attention to the processes and activities in the 4 spheres:
	- **Atmosphere**: Air and gases
	- **Lithosphere**: Rock layer
	- **Hydrosphere**: Water
	- **Biosphere**: Organisms

*The focus in ecology is restricted to the superficial layer of the Earth where life exists…..like the skin of an apple.*

# Biotic Features in the Environment

# Levels of Organization found in an Ecosystem
- **Species:** **individuals** that share common genetic characteristics and able to breed and produce viable offspring
- **Population:** **members of a species** interacting in groups that live together in a particular place or habitat. Population is ONE species.
- **Community:** consists of **populations of different species** living and interacting in an area (**living**)
- **Ecosystem:** is a community (**living**) interacting with its physical and chemical environment (**non-living**). All 4 spheres.
- **Landscapes:** connections linking several ecosystems in a particular region.

# Systems are “Wired” with Feedback Loops
- All component parts are interacting (ex: bodies are a system)
- Defined: The output of the system feeds back into the system as an input and leads to changes in that system.

## Two types of feedback loops
- Negative Feedback Loop
- Positive Feedback Loop

# Negative Feedback Loop
- Input and output essentially cancel out, stabilising the system
- Wolf and rabbit example (no significant change)

# Positive Feedback Loops
- The output feeds back into the system and drives it further in one direction toward an extreme
- Population increases, no predators, keeps increasing.
- Snowball effect.

# Energy Flows in Ecosystems

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240115121227.png)

- Arrows flow in one direction ; Energy flows in one direction.
- Most energy is lost to the environment

**Energy:** Capacity or ability to do work
- Organisms require energy to grow, move, reproduce, etc.
- **Flows** through ecosystems in one direction as it travels in all directions from the Sun
- Two forms of energy to consider: potential and kinetic
![[Pasted image 20240117113040.png]]
- Sugars(glucose) are the stored energies in our bodies

# First Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy cannot be created but can be transformed:

### Examples
- Solar energy transformed into thermal/heat energy
- Solar energy transformed into sugars by plants through a process of photosynthesis

*Need plants to have an ecosystem*

# Second Law of Thermodynamics
Energy transformations are very inefficient
- As transformed there is tremendous loss that is not useful
- Lots lost as heat that is unusable biologically
- Heat released into air and dissipates into space.

*Only about 10% is transferred each time (ex: plant -> herbivore -> carnivore), so can only have 4-5 trophic levels*

# A. Producers (Autotrophs) are the Solar Energy transformers
- Plants trap solar energy and transforms it into chemical/potential energy in the form of sugars
- Energy is trapped in the bonds between C and H and O
- Process is called **photosynthesis**. 

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240117114738.png)

***Carbon dioxide + Water + Solar Energy -> Glucose/Sugar + Oxygen***

Note: Glucose has Carbon.

Converted to ***kinetic energy*** by all living organisms, includes work, heat, light
Process is called **respiration**.  Opposite of photosynthesis

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240117115120.png)

Note that **combustion** and **decomposition** are other reactions that also result in the release of stored potential energy.

# B. Consumers – Heterotrophs
- Feed on others to obtain potential energy
	- Herbivores - 2nd trophic level | Primary consumer
	- Carnivores
	- Omnivores

# C. Decomposers
- Break down remains and waste products as a part of the cycling of materials
- They **DO NOT** recycle energy

**Examples**: Fungi, Bacteria

# Flow of Energy – Food Chains and Webs

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240117115511.png)

**Note:**  
- Second Trophic Level is the primary consumer,
- Third Trophic Level is the secondary consumer

## Food Web Example

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240117120215.png)

- Keep in mind: Relative to food chains.  
- Ex: Omnivore is always in at least 2 chains, and always at 2nd trophic level in at least one chain.
- Better for organism to have multiple sources of food.
-> Food Web Worksheet on UM Learn.

# Pyramid of Energy
- Big number at start of food chain, small number at top (more vulnerable to extinction).

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240117120633.png)

- Explained by second law

*Sugar is potential energy, made by plants using photosynthesis*
*plants and trees are fundamental/ultimate transformers*
*Few trophic levels, energy lost as heat, 2nd law*
*Autotroph -> Makes own food, self-feeder (plants)*
*Heterotroph -> consume others*

# Biological Production
- A method to quantify the energy trapped by (plants)
- Measured as changes in **biomass** (weight/unit area) over time or between locations

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240117120909.png)

- Used extensively to assess changes over time, between locations etc. Documents changes in desertification, deforestation, deforestation for example.

*Sometimes we want a lot of energy trapped (farms), sometimes we do not (algae)*


## Biomass is weight per unit area

## Productivity is a difference in biomass
- Assessing state of environment
- Not always good, algae example.

# Why is this Useful?

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240119114607.png)

- Using satellites to determine productivity
- Deep green = forest = high productivity
- Oceans: Red high (heavy pollution), purple low.

# Material Cycling - Bio- geo- chemical Cycles
- Materials move from one place (source) to another (sink) by way of a pathway (arrow). Call these reservoirs
- Typically involves atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, biosphere
- organisms on earth have greatly altered the cycling of chemicals because the chemicals are the nutrients to support life

Bio - organisms
Geo - physical
chemical - reactions

# Chemicals are the Nutrients for Organisms

### Macronutrients (SPONCH)
- required in large amounts as cell “building blocks”
- Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Sulphur (S)
- May also include Calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and chloride ions in the list given the demand

### Micronutrients
- Elements required in small amounts or moderate amounts by only some forms of life (vitamins, coenzymes)

### Availability of these chemicals influences what species will be present in the environment and how many individuals can be supported in that environment
- Size of a population; how quickly the population can reproduce
- Which species will be favoured in the ecosystem

# Carbon Cycle
- Organic carbon is the stuff in organisms (associated with life/biosphere)
- Glucose is an organic carbon
- inorganic is other
- Geological and Biological Cycles for Carbon

## Geological Cycle
- no life, carbon moving by physical processes, no life

## Biological 
- Life using it.

# The Carbon Cycle
\[[Unit 2 - Ecology and Ecosystem Dynamics 2024-01-22 11.36.22.excalidraw]]

# Positive Feedback
- More forest fires
- More decomposition

# Negative Feedback
- put into oceans, oceans give back
- photosynthesis


## ON TEST
- tell me about what moves carbon around
	- different spheres, talk about processes
- Look at responses to use putting carbon in atmosphere
	- positive and negative feedback
	- positive is bad, negative good
- organic compounds create potential energy

\![[Unit 2 - Ecology and Ecosystem Dynamics 2024-01-22 12.10.04.excalidraw]]

# The Nitrogen Cycle
- Nitrogen sueless to most plants
- bacteria controls everything
- Atmosphere --> Lithosphere    (Bacteria)

\![[Unit 2 - Ecology and Ecosystem Dynamics 2024-01-24 11.36.33.excalidraw]]

# Nitrogen Fixation (STEP 1)
- nitrogen gas into ammonia
	- Rhizobium ad cyanobacteria

## Industrial Fertilizer production
Humans can produce ammonia manuals


# Nitrogen Cycle
1. Nitrogen Fixation
2. Nitrification
3. Denitrification
4. Ammonia and Nitrate Uptake
5. Ammonification
*Memorise steps.*

Nitrogen Fixation and Ammonification are distinct (different sources on nitrogen)

# Phosphorus (P) Cycle
- **No significant amount** of phosphorus gas (big difference with other cycles)
	- Exists in the form of P combined with O and other molecules – orthophosphate
- **ESSENTIAL** for biosphere, controls a lot.
- **Major reservoirs** include rock and soils; plants and animals; very little dissolved in water (unless polluted); sediments of lakes and oceans
- P liberated from rock through the slow process of weathering and erosion (or agricultural activities)
	- Slow release
	- Patchy distribution around the world
	- Guano (bird droppings) represent rich deposits from sea birds
- Phosphorus crucial element in building DNA, energy, and healthy bones.

*Phosphorus out of rocks is same as carbon (hit by rain, slow)*
*When becomes available it is rapidly taken by biosphere*
**IF** *gets in to water, a plant their will take it*

Phosphorus in two places
- rocks
- biosphere

# Human Mine for Phosphorus
Our demand for phosphorus in agricultural and domestic activities creates water pollution:
- mining sources for cleaning products (shampoos, detergents)
- municipalities add P to drinking water; treated effluent often has high levels of P;
- a key component of fertilizers;
- Improper land application contributes to runoff in water bodies and algal growth as a results (details of this to follow)


# Phosphorus
- No atmosphere --> leads to patchy distribution
- Farmers need it, so they take and bring too much, then goes into hydrosphere (bad)
- Hungry plants and trees take it all before getting to hydrosphere

*Carbon and phosphorus most similar*
*Know cycles in and out*
*Fertilizers and shampoos/detergents are forms of phosphorus*
