*Anoxia: no oxygen*
- can happen in water if too much decomposition
- opposite of photosynthesis reaction
# Properties of Water
- High heat capacity - holds lots of energy
- Ice expand when freezes - floats on water
- Moderates climate
- Universal solvent - dissolve almost anything

# Hydrological Cycle
- 3% of water is freshwater, 0.5% in groundwater, most in glaciers
- Cycle
	- Evaporation - fresh water to atmosphere, purifies water
	- Condensation
	- Precipitation
	- Transpiration - on plants

# Groundwater Dynamics
- Water percolates into the ground, termed infiltration
	- depends on saturation and permeability (pore spaces vs clay)
- Water table: below saturated zone, above is unsaturated ground zone
![[Pasted image 20240327114600.png]]
- If take water from ground, water table decreases, wells may not reach water anymore
- Is ground water flow.
- **Influent Stream** - going into ground
	- gravity pushing water into unsaturated area
	- Gets recharge from runoff
- **Effluent Stream** - flowing out of ground
	- water table above stream, water leaves cuz pressure
	- Gets recharge from runoff and discharge from ground
- For groundwater, it *has* to rain
- Note: runoff is not freshwater
# Surface Waters
Lake Winnipeg Watershed
- Watershed, sink with a drain, Lake Winnipeg is the drain & watershed
- runoff puts tons of contaminants into Lake Winnipeg

# Water Quality
- The physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of water necessary to sustain desired water uses
- **Physical** - what's in water, who's in water
	- **Light** - need for photosynthesis for oxygen for life, need light
		- change light by erosional activities
			- dirt in water = less light
- **Chemical** - **nitrogen**, **phosphorus**, plant growth, too much, algae
	- Lake Winnipeg Algae
	- Sewage and manure - farming and toilets, profound effects
	- **dissolved oxygen (DO),** can have too little to support life
	- **Dead Stuff (Organic Carbon)** - energy
- **Biotic Responses** - **plants** like algae(influence oxygen), **fish** are good, **bacteria** (eat dead stuff, demand oxygen, suffocate fish)

# Sources of Pollution
- **Point source pollution** – out of a pipe concentrated discharge such as sewage effluent. Know exactly where pollution is coming from
- **Non-point source** – over a large area within the watershed, diffuse and much more difficult to control and regulate. Cannot pinpoint where pollution is coming from

# Sediment Pollution
- soil particles from erosion
- accumulate at bottom, takes away habitat
- Problems:
	- **Turbidity** - reduces light penetration
	- **Siltation** that destroys fish habitat
	- Adhered pollutants
# Eutrophication (Nutrient Pollution)
- nitrogen and phosphorus that encourage growth
- **Cultural Eutrophication**: Humans accelerate natural processes that normally take thousands of years into 10 years
- increases carrying capacities of algae
- Large mats of plants reduce health of ecosystem, take light
- From sewage, fertiliser, shampoos
- Lower nutrients = more biodiversity
![[Pasted image 20240327121807.png]]
- after all dead, decomposers take all the oxygen for their decomposition reaction, anoxia, no oxygen, eutrophication kills fish, 
# Decomposition and Oxygen Sag
- uses DO, dissolved oxygen
- Org-C + DO → CO2 + H2O
- More food (Org-C) for decomposers = higher decomposition rate
- Sources of Org-C
	- Natural Sources - leaf litter, fish, trees, branches, animal
	- Human Sources - sewage, manure
	- Eutrophied Water - Generates org-C because excessive plant growth

# Organic Pollution: DO Sag and Biodiversity Loss
- Oxygen Sag - dissolved oxygen declines in concentration in polluted area, cant regenerate fast enough
	- oxygen demand spikes at pipe pollution, then decreases
![[Pasted image 20240401115558.png]]
- High BOD lead to fish having nowhere to live - **Winter Fish Kill** - no oxygen
	- algae die from cold, ice on top doesn't let oxygen in, bacteria eats algae that dies, take all oxygen, fish all die

# Measure Bacterial Demand for Dissolved Oxygen in Decomposition
- **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)**
	- Determine rates of decomposition through an assessment of the DO consumed by bacterial community
	- The amount of oxygen that is used by decomposers over a period of time to break down organic matter present in a given water sample.
	- Seal off bottle (no oxygen in), put in dark (no photosynthesis), measure DO before and after, determines BOD
	![[Pasted image 20240401120020.png]]
	- we want low Org-C in our waters

# Pathogens and Water Quality
- Fecal coliforms are pathogens originating from fecal materials from sewage, manure, water treatment failure
	- One example is E. coli
- 3 Types:
	- bacteria
	- viruses
	- protozoa
- **Bacterial Counts** found by growing a population on a petri plate
- in a 100ml sample
	- Must be 0 colonies in drinking water
	- less than 200 coliform colonies to swim

# Cyanobacterial Dominance
- Lake Winnipeg dominated by them
- Cyanobacteria:
	- outcompete organisms for oxygen and nutrients
	- blue/green algae
	- fix nitrogen gas to form ammonia (nitrogen fixation)
- Should be 16 N : 1 P    -->   N to P ratio
	- Lake Winnipeg is 16 N : 4 P, so too much phosphorus
		- nitrogen not a problem, cant just add nitrogen to fix ratio because it is toxic to fish
		- Good algae take nitrogen, then some phosphorus when needed
		- Cyanobacteria take nitrogen gas from atmosphere and then take phosphorus, as much as they want

# Maintaining Water Quality
- Point Source **Sewage Treatment**
- Non-point source treatment
	- **Storm Water** runoff in cities
	- **Agricultural Run-off**

# Sewage Treatment City of Winnipeg


# Municipal Sewage Treatment
- 3 Steps
	- **Primary**
		- separating solids and liquids
		- at best remove sediment pollution
	- **Secondary**
		- add oxygen and sludge(bacteria) to remove organic material
			- jacking up rates of decomposition so no food for bacteria once in river
			- digest dead stuff / organic carbon
		- disinfection, killing pathogens
	- Tertiary
		- removing nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus

# Non-Point Source Pollution Issues in Surface Water Quality - Urban Centres
- Runoff brings tons of pollutants to rivers, cities must deal with it
- **Combined Sewers**
	- Rain water combined with sewage
	- if get too much, it overflow the weir/dam and goes into rivers
	- the non-overflow gets treated before deposition into river
	- horrible way to handle runoff
![[Pasted image 20240403114904.png]]
# **Wetlands / Riparian Zones**
- incredible water purification, must have ton of vegetation on water edge, like cattails, suck up nutrients
- water into storm drain goes to wetland, holds water and sediments go down.  Bacteria in soils break down organics.  Vegetations sucks of nutrients.  Then is released via gate into river, diluting nitrogen and phosphorus (good)
- soils have ton of bacteria, take nutrients from farmland runoff, converting to CO2

# Ecosystem Services of Riparian Zones
- Trap sediments
- filter water of pollutants and pathogens
- Stabilise stream banks
- store floodwater and energy
- Recharge groundwater
- Enhance biodiversity
- Increase plant production --> sustainable harvesting
