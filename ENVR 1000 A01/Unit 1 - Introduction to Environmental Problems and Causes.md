# ENVR-1000 WHOLE COURSE

## What is the Environment?

In this course, Environment provides us with the **ecological goods and
services** - We have a connection with it; **influence each other**

## Forest example
-   Goods: Tangible items, wood, shelter, house
-   Services: trees naturally regenerate, oxygen production

## Resources - Perpetual, Renewable and Non-renewable
- Arrow goes both ways,
continuum - Renewable resource shares perpetual and non-renewable
features

**Perpetual** - Can't degenerate these resources; use forever into
future

**Non-renewable** - Once run out its gone - Fossil fuels, take millions
of years to convert - limited quantity or take longgggg time to be
generated

**Renewable** - Regenerate through ecological service - Moving towards
behaving like non-renewable - Need to manage correctly

# Two Themes Explain Humanities Negative Impacts on the Environment

# Theme 1: Over-Population
-   14000 BC, hunter-gatherer, productivity decreases, leave,
    environments regenerates
-   2024 AD, farming, productivity decreases, can't leave, 

## 2 Things
-   Excessive demand on resources
-   forces us to stay put and not let environment recover

# Industrialised vs Developing Nations

-   industrialised countries have peaked in population
-   Developing regions growing

# Theme 2: Over-Consumption of Natural Resources

-   One person in an **industrialised nation** consumes far more than an
    individual from a **developing nation**
-   **20%** of the worlds population consumes more than **50%** of the
    world's resources
-   1 person in Canada \> 12 individuals in a developing nation!
-   Related to how much money we have to spend

# Why is footprint different between places
-   Population: more mouths to feed = larger footprint
-   Poverty = lower footprint, luxury = higher footprint
-   1.6 for whole world to sustain, Canada average is like 8 \

## From Online Map
-   Green was supply \> demand, good
-   Red was supply \< demand, bad

# Think about bank account
-   if just take out interest, will get same interest in future
-   if take out more, then will have less interest for next withdrawal
    (capital shrinks)

# 1983 - Emergence of Sustainable Development (SD)
-   Control overpopulation, eradicate poverty and reduce consumption to
    promote environmental sustainability.

# Sustainable Development:
- Meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs 
- Decision-making encompassing needs
of society and human well-being; economic prosperity and all within the
context of environmental limitations and constraints. 
- *"How can we all live well within the limitations of one planet"*

# Principles of Sustainable Development -- 3 Pillars

![](../Images/Pasted%20image%2020240112121516.png)

# Environment, Social, Economic 
- **NEEDS** **equal balance** between three Pillars (cannot prioritise one)
    - 1/3 **Environment** Pillar
    - 1/3 **Social** Pillar
    - 1/3 **Economic** Pillar

# The "Science" in Environmental Science

Why do we use a foundation of scientific study to examine environmental
issues? 
- We can devise experiments 
- We can study cause and effect relationships; building complexity in our understanding of how the
environment "behaves". 
- Theories and laws about the way our natural world operates flow from scientific research 
- Knowledge gained through scientific research contributes to political decisions made by our
governments

## Example

You are walking along a riverbank and observe a pipe discharging something into the river. You continue walking and notice a change in the appearance of the water. There is a thick green mat of something floating on the top of the water column. \

## The Scientific Method - Example continued

A famous study discovered phosphorus was causing this (plant fertilisers).
