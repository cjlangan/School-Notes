# Regeneration of our Lands video

 *Look for problems and solutions*

- Loss of biodiversity --> destruction of soil
 - top soil shrank in depth
 - organic matter shrank
 - rain can't infiltrate
	 - resorting to tile drainage --> soil goes to watershed along with nutrients
- Lack of biodiversity, lower nutrient cycling
	- put in own, ruin everything
- Weeds from synthetic fertilizer
	- use herbicides, binds metal (nutrients), unavailable to plant, prone to disease, spray fungicides --> detrimental to soil biology, pests effect, spray pesticides --> decline predator insects and pollinators
- Current production model is all about killing
- Fewer children in schools, ruins health (lower nutrient densities in food), US spends tons on health care but still leads in diseases
- Natures way - Conventional Way
	- no mechanical disturbance
	- armour on surface
	- cycles water efficiently, infiltration perfect
	- living plant networks all throughout growing season
- 400 years ago tons of diversity
- 5 Principles
	- Least amount of mechanical disturbance
		- infiltration
	- Armour on soil surface - protect from wind and soil erosion
		- infiltration
	- Soil diversity - 
		- more nutrients
	- Living roots in ground as long as possible
		- nutrients
	- Animal impact - out on pasture
		- 
- 1700 beneficial insects for every pest
- More nutrient dense at lower cost
- infiltration depth increased

# Windy Video
- field eroded, on hot sunny day, dust everywhere, goes into ditches or rivers

# Tilled vs No Till Soils Video
- Tilled is lighter
- Till has little pore space
- Till has less nutrients and nutrient recycling
- Till has less organic matter
- untilled held by organisms
- Tilled is eroded in water
- tilled soil has runoff

# Types of Agriculture
- **Subsistence**: 
	- production small with goal to produce for family and local community
	- common in developing nations
- **Industrialized**: 
	- large commercial farms, maximise profit
	- lots of mechanization
	- chemicals
	- species diversity not important
	- NA, China, Russia

# Green Revolution
- 1940's-60's
- Enhanced crop production to Feed Population
	- new crop varieties, higher yields
	- chemical fertilizers
	- synthetic pesticides
	- lower production costs

# Modern Agro-Ecosystems
- goal is monoculture/ low biodiversity
- planted in rows, lack spatial complexity
- tillage

# Natural Landscape
- pests can't access easily, due to structural complexity

*Next two sections are a recap from Ted Talk Video*

# Soil Decline with Conventional Farming
- Tillage activities (ploughing) can accelerate breakdown of organic matter/decomposition rates;
- Further loss of soil organic matter arises through burning and removal of crop residue
- Tillage impairs aggregate structure (no longer sticky and disintegrates)
- Bare and exposed soils encounter more erosion
- Poor nutrient cycling and less soil community
- Pesticides and synthetic fertilizers affect beneficial microorganisms
- Poor water infiltration and water storage when the aggregate mixture is disrupted and leads to greater dependency on irrigation and risks of pesticide/fertilizer runoff

# Regenerative Strategies
- Lessen disturbance = review tillage practices
- cover crop – “armour” on the soil to minimize erosional processes with living roots in the ground as long as possible
- Improve nutrient cycling so that inorganic fertilizer application can be reduced
- Use biological processes to “feed the soils"
- diversity of plants leads to diversity in the soil community - improving SOM and infiltration
	- crop rotation; polyculture cropping
- domesticated animals mimic the natural disturbance of grazers historically and with healthier soils the stocking rate can be much greater
	- rotational grazing schedules

***Legume --> nitrogen fixation***

# Slash and Burn Agriculture
- Forests cut and burned for ash to use as fertilizer
- productive soils only for short period
- Forest regrowth fails due to poor soil development
- Need to have canopy for shade, cover crop

# Livestock in Africa
- livestock used in rotational grazing
- degraded regions restored, manure
- loss of grazers had the opposite effect
