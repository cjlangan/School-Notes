COMP 2160 - Lecture 22 examples
===============================

Here are some examples that we saw in class in Lecture 22.

`main.c`
--------

This is currently a starter template for getting going with C development for
the Game Boy Advance. Compiling this code requires that you have [installed
Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

You can compile this code on the command line with `make`:

    make

You can run this code in a Game Boy Advance emulator like `mgba`:

    mgba-qt main.gba
