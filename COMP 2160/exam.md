## Final Exam
- 2 hours
- need 92% for A+, assuming 100% all assignements
- Comprehensive (all stated outcomes to be assessed)
- Second half more tested on though
- Assigned Seating
- In 100 Fletcher Argue.
- Structure like Midterm
    - MC, short answer, programming 
- Why or why not cohesive. High/low coupling.

### Programming
- bulk of points, around 50% +- 10%. 
- will implement an ADT, use linked lists. Header file is given.
- Could be hash table, look at 2140 interfaces.
- Queues, Stacks, Trees. Won't be zone-based memory maanger
- apply design by contract, assertions
- defensive programming.
- Must write test cases.  However, not have to write code for test cases.
    - Come up with input and expected output, what functions to verify that.
    - General and Edge.
- Just one massive programming question.
- Can draw arrows to insert lines.

## Course Offerings - 2160 - Website UM.
- Explain purpose of testing code. - Make sure code does what it says it does.
- purpose of automated testing.  Obvious.
- Recognise risky programming techniques, and how they differ in different high-level programming languages. 
    - think about all we learned about C v.s. Java. Access to all memory, bounds, etc.
- When passing arrays for example, pass the array size.
- When assert something isn't NULL, must use if-condition as well.
- Compile .o, and link into another C file. Should be able to write these commands.
- Be able to tell how much cohesion in short code sample. Also coupling. Why.
- Given code using Data structure, ask if possible to change it. EX: arraylist to hash.
- Describe first-fit memory allocation policy given example situation. Draw.
- Prob wont ask about stack (was on midterm).  Could do Heap.
- Address space of running program, 
- Declare function pointer
- assign value to function pointer
- call funciton pointer
- redirecting standard input and output for file I/O.
- Write code that can read input and print to output (putchar)
- Bit manipulation (not too much), arithmetic?
